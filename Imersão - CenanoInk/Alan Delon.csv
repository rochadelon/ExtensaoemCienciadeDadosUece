With limited understanding of the TiO2 TiN interfacial system at present, this work aims to describe the structural and electronic properties of oxidized TiN based on a density functional theory (DFT) study of the rutile TiO2(110)- TiN(100) interface model system, also including Hubbard +U correction on Ti 3d states. The small lattice mismatch gives a good stability to the TiO2 TiN interface after depositing the oxide onto TiN through the formation of interfacial Ti-O bonds. Our DFT+U study shows the presence of Ti3+ cations in the TiO2 region, which are preferentially located next to the interface region as well as the rotation of the rutile TiO2 octahedra in the interface structure. The DFT+U TiO2 electronic density of states (EDOS) shows localized Ti3+ defect states forming in the midgap between the top edge of the valence and the bottom of the conduction band. We increase the complexity of our models by the introduction of nonstoichiometric compositions. Although the vacancy formation energies for Ti in TiN (E-vac (Ti) >= 4.03 eV) or O in the oxide (E-vac (O) >= 3.40 eV) are quite high relative to perfect TiO2-TiN, defects are known to form during the oxide growth and can therefore be present after TiO2 formation. Our results show that a structure with exchanged O and N can lie 0.82 eV higher in energy than the perfect system, suggesting the stability of structures with interdiffused O and N anions at ambient conditions. The presence of N in TiO2 introduces N 2p states localized between the top edge of the O 2p valence states and the midgap Ti3+ 3d states, thus reducing the band gap in the TiO2 region for the exchanged O/N interface EDOS. The outcomes of these simulations give us a most comprehensive insight on the atomic level structure and the electronic properties of oxidized TiN surfaces.","[Moreno, Jose Julio Gutierrez; Nolan, Michael] Univ Coll Cork, Tyndall Natl Inst, Cork T12 RSCP, Ireland",University College Cork,"Moreno, JJG (corresponding author), Univ Coll Cork, Tyndall Natl Inst, Cork T12 RSCP, Ireland.",julio.gutierrez@tyndall.ie,"Nolan, Michael/A-9319-2008; Gutierrez Moreno, Jose Julio/D-4355-2017","Nolan, Michael/0000-0002-5224-8580; Gutierrez Moreno, Jose Julio/0000-0002-1564-9879",Environmental Protection Agency [W-2015-MS-21]; DJEI/DES/SFI/HEA; PRACE aisbl,Environmental Protection Agency; DJEI/DES/SFI/HEA(Science Foundation Ireland (SFI)); PRACE aisbl,This work was supported by the Environmental Protection Agency UisceSense project (W-2015-MS-21).

We conducted magnified characterizations using a microscope and XRD analysis to observe phase transformations, and TGA-DTA analysis to determine the thermal resistance. Thermal characterizations showed improved heat resistance with relatively high polysiloxane content slurry. Cross-sectional optical microscope observation showed less melting near the surface and decreased pore formation area with higher polysiloxane content slurry. XRD analysis revealed that the block and coating layer were amorphous phases. TGA-DTA analysis showed an endothermic reaction at around 550 degrees C as the polysiloxane in the coating layer reacted to form SiOC. Therefore, coating polysiloxane on a borosilicate block contributes to preventing the melting of the block at temperatures above 800 degrees C.","[Song, Jeongho; Song, Ohsung] Univ Seoul, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Seoul 02504, South Korea",University of Seoul,"Song, O (corresponding author), Univ Seoul, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Seoul 02504, South Korea.",songos@uos.ac.kr,,,,,,,13.0,3,3,1,5,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1229-7801,2234-0491,,J KOREAN CERAM SOC,J.

Fe2O3 thin films were prepared on fluorine doped tin oxide(FTO) conducting substrates by spin coating of a precursor solution followed by annealing at 550 degrees C for 30 min. in air ambient. Specifically, the precursor solution was prepared by dissolving non-toxic FeCl3 as an Fe source in highly versatile dimethyl sulfoxide(DMSO) as a solvent. The as-deposited and annealed thin films were characterized for their morphological, structural and optical properties using field-emission scanning electron microscopy(FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction(XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy(XPS) and UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy. The photoelectrochemical performance of the precursor (alpha-FeOOH) and annealed (alpha-Fe2O3) films were characterized and it was found that the alpha-Fe2O3 film exhibited an increased photocurrent density of similar to 0.78 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is about 3.4 times higher than that of the alpha-FeOOH films (0.23 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE). The improved performance can be attributed to the improved crystallinity and porosity of alpha-Fe2O3 thin films after annealing treatment at higher temperatures. Detailed electrical characterization was further carried out to elucidate the enhanced PEC performance of alpha-Fe2O3 thin films.","[Suryawanshi, Mahesh P.; Ghorpade, Uma V.; Suryawanshi, Umesh P.; Jang, Jun Sung; Gang, Myeng Gil; Kim, Jin Hyeok; Moon, Jong Ha] Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Optoelect Convergence Res Ctr, 77 Yongbong Ro, Gwangju 500757, South Korea; [Kim, Seonghyeop] Feelstone Inc, R&D Div, 37 Eco Gil, Damyang Gun 517700, Jeollanam Do, South Korea",Chonnam National University,"Kim, JH; Moon, JH (corresponding author), Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Optoelect Convergence Res Ctr, 77 Yongbong Ro, Gwangju 500757, South Korea.",jinhyeok@chonnam.ac.kr; jhmoon@chonnam.ac.kr,"Suryawanshi, Mahesh/U-3525-2019; Suryawanshi, Mahesh P./P-4995-2018","Jang, Jun Sung/0000-0003-3715-2297; Ghorpade, Uma V./0000-0001-8631-7030; Suryawanshi, Mahesh P./0000-0003-4711-7655","Human Resources Development program of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) grant - Korea government Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy [20164030201310]; Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning(KETEP); Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy(MOTIE) of the Republic of Korea [20173010012980]","Human Resources Development program of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) grant - Korea government Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy; Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning(KETEP); Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy(MOTIE) of the Republic of Korea","This work was supported by the Human Resources Development program(No. 20164030201310) of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) grant funded by the Korea government Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy and was partially supported by the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning(KETEP) and the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy(MOTIE) of the Republic of Korea(No. 20173010012980).",,16.0,5,5,0,46,MATERIALS RESEARCH SOC KOREA,SEOUL,"RM 903, KOREA SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY BLDG, 635-4, YEOKSAM-DONG, KANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-703, SOUTH KOREA",1225-0562,2287-7258,,KOR J MATER RES,Kor.

A mu-cell design is described that optimizes electron and photon collection with enhanced efficiency for solar concentration applications. An interdigitated back contact (IBC) design improves carrier collection partially due to larger contact coverage while further enabling optimization of the mu-cell front surface. To do so, a silicon nitride antireflection thin film coating is utilized to enhance photon absorption and improve surface passivation. Performance of IBC mu-cells is compared to an optimized top contact design and improves mu-cell conversion efficiencies from 9.9 to 13.7%. Improvements at 1 Sun are amplified under concentration and increase power densities at 20 Suns to 346 from 192 mW cm(-2) due to minimized series resistance. Benefits afforded by IBC mu-cells are exemplified following their integration into a dual concentrator system, affording photon collection capacities for direct and diffuse irradiance. A traditional lens concentrates direct light while a luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) collects diffuse photons otherwise not utilized by passive optics. Addition of the LSC increases maximum power densities on clear and cloudy days, providing concentration for the latter and further increasing the power density.","[Yoder, Mikayla A.; Yao, Yuan; He, Junwen; Nuzzo, Ralph G.] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, Fredrick Seitz Mat Res Lab, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Nuzzo, RG (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, Fredrick Seitz Mat Res Lab, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",r-nuzzo@illinois.edu,,,"Light-Material Interactions in Energy Conversion Energy Frontier Research Center - U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-SC0001293, 67N-1087758]","Light-Material Interactions in Energy Conversion Energy Frontier Research Center - U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","This work was supported by the Light-Material Interactions in Energy Conversion Energy Frontier Research Center funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences under Award Number DE-SC0001293 (subcontract no. 67N-1087758).

Different Grand Feu (leadless or lead-poor colourless and blue enamel) and Petit Feu (lead-rich red (hematite), yellow and green (Pb-Sn/Sb/X pyrochlore) and black enamels) glazes were respectively identified on wares from the wucai group, the Famille verte group, and the huafalang group. Calcium phosphate was detected in a 17th century vase as a rare opacifier. Cassiterite was identified in the light green glaze of an imperial huafalang bowl dated to the final period of the Kangxi reign (1662-1722), ca. the 1st quarter of the 18th century. Lead arsenate was identified in the blue glaze of two artefacts, a huafalang bowl and a painted enamel water dropper, and in the blue enamel of a 19th century Yixing teapot. Lead arsenate found in some of the blue enamels appears to arise from the arsenic content in Erzgebirge cobalt ores (Saxony) and not due to voluntary addition. This may prove the use of raw materials or enamel powder imported from Europe in developing these opaque colours. The use of lead arsenate as white opacifier is clear for a water dropper bearing the Yongzheng emperor's mark (r. 1723-1735). The technological palette appears different for the artefacts expected to originate from the same period and provenance (imperial workshop) which is consistent with a period of intense innovation, open to technological skill from abroad i.e. from French/European painted enamel technology as revealed by ancient French (Jesuits) and Chinese historical reports.","[Colomban, Philippe; Zhang, Yizheng] UPMC Univ Paris 06, CNRS, MONARIS UMR8233, Sorbonne Univ, 4 Pl Jussieu, F-75005 Paris, France; [Zhao, Bing] CNRS EPHE Coll France UPD07, CNRS, CRCAO UMR8155, 52 Rue Cardinal Lemoine, F-75005 Paris, France",Sorbonne Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Chemistry (INC); Universite Paris Cite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Colomban, P (corresponding author), UPMC Univ Paris 06, CNRS, MONARIS UMR8233, Sorbonne Univ, 4 Pl Jussieu, F-75005 Paris, France.",Philippe.colomban@upmc.fr,"Colomban, Philippe/H-8973-2019","COLOMBAN, Philippe/0000-0001-6099-5423",French-China Cai Yuanpei cooperative program [36685RB]; HORIBA Scientific Jobin-Yvon Company,French-China Cai Yuanpei cooperative program; HORIBA Scientific Jobin-Yvon Company,"The authors thank Mrs S.

To assess the cracking process driven by mechanical loading, in-situ three-point bending tests were conducted on TBCs samples having different top coats (TC) and bond coats (BC). The competition between cracks at TC/BC and BC/substrate interfaces was observed for the first time, and then analyzed to elucidate the mechanism. Experimental and numerical results show that the differences in modulus ratio and thickness ratio of TC to BC are the main factors controlling the competition, which eventually leads to different fracture modes, i.e. when TC thickness is large or BC modulus is low, the coatings peel off from the TC/BC interface; while, with the decreasing TC thickness or increasing BC modulus, the delamination location changes to BC/substrate interface. A failure map based on the two ratios is numerically established, which agrees well with the experimental results. It is advised that the crack propagation path can be controlled by adjusting the combination of the two ratios to trigger both TC/BC and BC/substrate interfacial cracks in TBCs, thereby leading to more energy dissipation and better bending-resistance.

Comprehensive understanding and precise measurements of residual stress are prerequisites for preparing high quality films and coatings. Residual stresses in TiN films with different thickness were measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD) employing the cos(2)alpha sin(2)psi method with certain optimization. Grazing incidence parallel beam optics was combined with side-inclination geometry using in-house designed sample stage to ensure results accuracy. To validate this method, TiN films with thickness ranging from 1 to 3 gm were deposited on (100) Si single crystal substrates at 300 degrees C by RF magnetron sputtering. High compressive -2GPa residual stress was present in the 0.9 mu m thick film and decreased with film thickness. Tensile stress of less than 0.3 GPa was present in 2 mu m TiN film. Compressive-to-tensile residual stress transition was observed with the film thickness increase.

The motivation was to develop a highly durable and flexible film for transparent conductive electrode applications. The overall characteristics of multilayers based on rGO, CNTs and AgNWs were found to be much better than those of the single-layer AgNW coating. The rGO and CNT layers served to protect the AgNW layer from damage due to bending and contact sliding motions. The contact pressure and bending stress were effectively distributed by the CNT layer deposited on top of the AgNW layer due to its spring-like behavior. In addition, the shear force from the friction force was reduced by the rGO top layer, which acted as a solid lubricant. Furthermore, the excellent performance of an HFTCE heater based on the rGO/CNT/AgNW coating was demonstrated by the results of a defrosting test.","[Kim, Chang-Lae; Kim, Dae-Eun] Yonsei Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Ctr Nanowear, Yonsei Ro 50, Seoul 03722, South Korea; [Jung, Chan-Won; Oh, Young-Jei] KIST, Ctr Optoelect Mat, Future Convergence Res Div, Hwarangno 14 Gil 5, Seoul 02792, South Korea",Yonsei University; Korea Institute of Science & Technology (KIST),"Kim, DE (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Ctr Nanowear, Yonsei Ro 50, Seoul 03722, South Korea.;Oh, YJ (corresponding author), KIST, Ctr Optoelect Mat, Future Convergence Res Div, Hwarangno 14 Gil 5, Seoul 02792, South Korea.",youngjei@kist.re.kr; kimde@yonsei.ac.kr,"Kim, Dae-Eun/AAR-2973-2021","Kim, Chang-Lae/0000-0002-1983-0181; Kim, Dae-Eun/0000-0002-6095-5138",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant - Korea government (MSIT) [2010-0018289],National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant - Korea government (MSIT),This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. 2010-0018289).,,40.0,105,111,0,82,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,NEW YORK,"75 VARICK ST, 9TH FLR, NEW YORK, NY 10013-1917 USA",1884-4049,1884-4057,,NPG ASIA MATER,NPG Asia Mater.,OCT 13,2017,9.0,,,,,,,,e438,10.1038/am.2017.177,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/am.2017.177,,,9.0,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Materials Science,FK1JJ,,gold,,,2025-04-23 00:00:00,WOS:000413236600002,View Full Record in Web of Science,

We leveraged this modulation of phase separation to generate composite surfaces with dynamic friction coefficients that were substantially lower than expected on the basis of simple mixing rules, and in several cases, these friction coefficients were lower than those of both pure components. Using a model polyisoprene [PI]/polystyrene [PS] composite system, a minimum mu was found in films with PS mass fractions between 0.60 and 0.80 (mu(blend) = 0.11 +/- 0.03); that value was significantly lower than the friction coefficient of PS (mu(ps) = 0.52 +/- 0.01) or PI (mu(PI) = 1.3 +/- 0.09) homopolymers and was comparable to the friction coefficient of poly(tetrafluoroethylene) [PTFE] (mu(PTFE) = 0.09 +/- 0.01) measured under similar conditions. Additionally, through experiments in which the domain size was systematically varied at constant composition (through an annealing process), we demonstrated that mu decreased with decreasing characteristic domain size. Thus, the tribological synergy between PS and PI domains (discrete size, physical domain isolation, and overall film composition) was shown to play an integral role in the friction and wear of these PS/PI composites. Overall, our results suggest that even high friction polymers can be used to create low friction polymer blends by following appropriaste design rules and demonstrate that engineering microstructure is critical for controlling the friction and adhesion properties of composite films for tribologically relevant coatings.","[Emerson, Jillian A.; Furst, Eric M.; Epps, Thomas H., III] Univ Delaware, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Garabedian, Nikolay T.; Burris, David L.] Univ Delaware, Dept Mech Engn, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Moore, Axel C.] Univ Delaware, Dept Biomed Engn, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Epps, Thomas H., III] Univ Delaware, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Newark, DE 19716 USA",University of Delaware; University of Delaware; University of Delaware; University of Delaware,"Furst, EM; Epps, TH (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Newark, DE 19716 USA.;Burris, DL (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Dept Mech Engn, Newark, DE 19716 USA.;Epps, TH (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",dlburris@udel.edu; furst@udel.edu; thepps@udel.edu,"Garabedian, Nikolay/AAU-8795-2020","Furst, Eric/0000-0002-8849-4484; Garabedian, Nick/0000-0003-4049-4212; Epps, III, Thomas/0000-0002-2513-0966","Thomas and Kipp Gutshall Professorship in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of Delaware; NSF [CBET-1235955, CMMI-1434435]; NASA [NNX10AE44G]; University of Delaware; Delaware COBRE program; National Institute of General Medical Sciences - NIGMS from the National Institutes of Health [5 P30 GM110758-02]",Thomas and Kipp Gutshall Professorship in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of Delaware; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); University of Delaware; Delaware COBRE program; National Institute of General Medical Sciences - NIGMS from the National Institutes of Health,"J.A.E. and T.H.E. acknowledge the Thomas and Kipp Gutshall Professorship in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of Delaware for financial support.

Strong interactions between cobalt and the support may lead to irreducible cobalt oxide formation, which is detrimental for the catalytic performance. Therefore, several strategies have been proposed to enhance cobalt reducibility, such as alloying with Pt or utilization of nonoxide supports. In this work, we fabricate bimetallic PtCo supported on graphene-coated ZnO with enhanced cobalt reducibility. By employing a model/planar catalyst formulation, we show that the surface reduction of cobalt oxide is substantially enhanced by the presence of the graphene support as compared to bare ZnO. Stimulated by these findings, we synthesized a realistic powder catalyst consisting of PtCo particles grafted on graphene-coated ZnO support. We found that the addition of graphene coating enhances the surface reducibility of cobalt, fully supporting the results obtained on the model system. Our study demonstrates that realistic catalysts with designed properties can be developed on the basis of insights gained from model catalytic formulation.","[Luo, Wen; Ba, Housseinou; Baati, Rachid; Cuong Pham-Huu; Zafeiratos, Spyridon] Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, ICPEES,UMR 7515, ECPM, 25 Rue Becquerel, F-67087 Strasbourg 02, France; [Baaziz, Walid; Ersen, Ovidiu] Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, IPCMS, UMR 7504, 23 Rue Loess, F-67037 Strasbourg 08, France; [Cao, Qing] Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, Inst Charles Sadron, 23 Rue Loess,BP 84047, F-67034 Strasbourg 2, France",Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Chemistry (INC); Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Physics (INP); Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Zafeiratos, S (corresponding author), Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, ICPEES,UMR 7515, ECPM, 25 Rue Becquerel, F-67087 Strasbourg 02, France.",spiros.zafeiratos@unistra.fr,"Ersen, Ovidiu/I-1983-2016; zafeiratos, spiros/JQW-9447-2023; Housseinou, BA/F-1146-2015; Luo, Wen/R-4139-2017","ERSEN, Ovidiu/0000-0002-1553-0915; Zafeiratos, Spyridon/0000-0001-8165-2585; Luo, Wen/0000-0003-4250-6168",China Scholarship Council (CSC),China Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council),W.L. would like to thank the China Scholarship Council (CSC) for a Ph.D. grant during his stay at the ICPEES.

In our experiment, a magnetron with a grounded cathode and positively biased anode was used as a source of plasma. A ring anode was positioned at 8 cm distance from the cathode. Samples of glass and cotton textile were placed at the plane of the anode. Ti and TiN coatings were deposited by sputtering of titanium target in Ar or Ar+ N-2 atmosphere. SEM studies showed that, using the magnetron system described above, the textile fibers were covered by the 2 mu m to 3 mu m thick coatings. Unexpectedly, the coatings were deposited at both sides of the samples: the front side was exposed to glow discharge plasma and the backside was completely shaded from the plasma. IR optical investigation exhibited significant change in reflectance and transmittance of the coated textiles. The using of standard magnetron system (grounded anode and cathode at negative potential) resulted in a coating deposition at the textile side exposed to the plasma action only. We believe that the multi-sided deposition of coatings observed during the process run with magnetron with grounded cathode is a result of an ambipolar diffusion mechanism in the anodic potential drop region.","[Chodun, Rafal; Wicher, Bartosz; Okrasa, Sebastian; Zdunek, Krzysztof] Warsaw Univ Technol, Fac Mat Sci, Woloska 141, PL-02507 Warsaw, Poland; [Skowronski, Lukasz; Grabowski, Andrzej] UTP Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Math & Phys, Al Prof S Kaliskiego 7, PL-85796 Bydgoszcz, Poland; [Nowakowska-Langier, Katarzyna] Natl Ctr Nucl Res NCBJ, A Soltana 7, PL-05400 Otwock, Poland; [Minikayev, Roman] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Phys, Lotnikow 32-46, PL-02668 Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Technology; Bydgoszcz University of Science & Technology; National Centre for Nuclear Research; Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Physics - Polish Academy of Sciences,"Chodun, R (corresponding author), Warsaw Univ Technol, Fac Mat Sci, Woloska 141, PL-02507 Warsaw, Poland.",rafal.chodun@inmat.pw.edu.pl,"Wicher, Bartosz/LMP-8878-2024; Zdunek, Krzysztof/ABH-4342-2020; Okrasa, Sebastian/KZO-9500-2024; Minikayev, Roman/S-5432-2016; Chodun, Rafal/M-6985-2014; Skowronski, Lukasz/F-3226-2014","Okrasa, Sebastian Andrzej/0000-0003-0787-0861; Minikayev, Roman/0000-0002-4334-7472; Chodun, Rafal/0000-0002-1028-3433; Skowronski, Lukasz/0000-0001-9416-1849; Nowakowska-Langier, Katarzyna/0000-0002-0146-4558; Zdunek, Krzysztof/0000-0002-8440-498X; Wicher, Bartosz/0000-0001-7104-3196",National Science Centre [2013/09/B/ST8/02418],"National Science Centre(National Science Centre, Poland)",This work was supported by the National Science Centre within the Project No. 2013/09/B/ST8/02418.,,23.0,6,6,0,5,DE GRUYTER POLAND SP ZOO,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR., 01-811 WARSAW, POLAND",2083-134X,,,MATER SCI-POLAND,Mater.

There is a powerful objection to such population engineering proposals: even if drastic fertility reductions are needed to prevent dangerous climate change, implementing those reductions would wreak havoc on the global economy, which would seriously undermine international antipoverty efforts. In this article, we articulate this economic objection to population engineering and show how it fails. We argue, first, that the economic objection paints an inaccurate picture of the complicated relationship between demographic change and economic growth, and second, that any untoward economic effects of fertility reduction can be mitigated with additional policies. Specifically, we argue that supplementing fertility reduction with policies that facilitate the emigration of younger people from developing nations to developed nations could allow for both global reductions in GHG emissions and continued economic stability. Further, we show that moral arguments against such unprecedented increases in immigration are unsuccessful. We conclude that population engineering is a practical and morally justifiable tool for addressing the twin evils of climate change and global poverty.","[Earl, Jake; Hickey, Colin] Georgetown Univ, Dept Philosophy, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Rieder, Travis N.] Johns Hopkins Berman Inst Bioeth, Educ Initiat, Baltimore, MD USA; [Rieder, Travis N.] Johns Hopkins Berman Inst Bioeth, Baltimore, MD USA",Georgetown University; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins University,"Rieder, TN (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Berman Inst Bioeth, 1809 Ashland Ave, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",trieder@jhu.edu,,"Hickey, Colin/0000-0003-2275-8130; Earl, Jake/0000-0003-3001-7885",,,,,36.0,12,12,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-9702,1467-8519,,BIOETHICS,Bioethics,OCT,2017,31.0,8,,,SI,,582,589,,10.1111/bioe.12374,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bioe.12374,,,8.0,"Ethics; Medical Ethics; Social Issues; Social Sciences, Biomedical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Social Sciences - Other Topics; Medical Ethics; Social Issues; Biomedical Social Sciences,FN2JY,28901603,Green Submitted,,,2025-04-23 00:00:00,WOS:000415819400003,View Full Record in Web of Science,

The effects of current density, pH, sodium gluconate concentration, cobalt sulphate concentration and deposition duration on the microstructure and cathodic efficiency are characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy, weight gain measurements and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry, respectively. Results show that increases in current density and deposition duration lead to decrease in current efficiency and deposition rate. Increasing the pH to 2.5 causes an initial rise of current efficiency and deposition rate, followed by subsequent decline. In addition, the increases in sodium gluconate and cobalt sulphate concentrations in the electrolyte solution result in an increase in current efficiency and deposition rate. Moreover, the results demonstrate that the variations in the current density, pH, sodium gluconate (NaC6H11O7) concentration, cobalt sulphate concentration (CoSO4 center dot 7H(2)O) and duration have a significant effect on grain size, uniformity and the adherence of the coating.","[Ebrahimifar, Hadi; Zandrahimi, Morteza] Shahid Bahonar Univ Kerman, Dept Met & Mat Sci, Fac Engn, Kerman 76169133, Iran",Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman (SBUK),"Ebrahimifar, H (corresponding author), Shahid Bahonar Univ Kerman, Dept Met & Mat Sci, Fac Engn, Kerman 76169133, Iran.",H.Ebrahimifar@eng.uk.ac.ir,,,,,,,47.0,14,14,1,41,INDIAN ACAD SCIENCES,BANGALORE,"C V RAMAN AVENUE, SADASHIVANAGAR, P B #8005, BANGALORE 560 080, INDIA",0250-4707,0973-7669,,B MATER SCI,Bull.

Repression of the Drosophila nanos mRNA, required for the formation of the anterior-posterior body axis, depends on the protein Smaug binding to two Smaug recognition elements (SREs) in the nanos 3' UTR. In a comprehensive mass spectrometric analysis of the SRE-dependent repressor complex, we identified Smaug, Cup, Me31B, Trailer hitch, eIF4E, and PABPC, in agreement with earlier data. As a novel component, the RNA-dependent ATPase Belle (DDX3) was found, and its involvement in deadenylation and repression of nanos was confirmed in vivo. Smaug, Cup, and Belle bound stoichiometrically to the SREs, independently of RNA length. Binding of Me31B and Tral was also SRE-dependent, but their amounts were proportional to the length of the RNA and equimolar to each other. We suggest that coating of the RNA by a Me31B.Tral complex may be at the core of repression.","[Goetze, Michael; Rammelt, Christiane; Temme, Claudia; Wahle, Elmar] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biochem & Biotechnol, D-06099 Halle, Germany; [Dufourt, Jeremy; Pierson, Stephanie; Sambrani, Nagraj; Simonelig, Martine] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, UMR9002, Inst Human Genet, F-34396 Montpellier 5, France; [Ihling, Christian; Sinz, Andrea] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Pharm, D-06099 Halle, Germany; [Temme, Claudia] IDT, Pharmapk, D-06861 Dessau Rosslau, Germany",Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Montpellier; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Wahle, E (corresponding author), Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biochem & Biotechnol, D-06099 Halle, Germany.",ewahle@biochemtech.uni-halle.de,"Götze, Michael/P-6687-2016; Dufourt, Jeremy/Y-5027-2019","Simonelig, Martine/0000-0002-3731-6979; Wahle, Elmar/0000-0003-2504-0677; Gotze, Michael/0000-0003-4001-2324; Dufourt, Jeremy/0000-0003-4043-7250","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [WA 548/13-2, FOR 855, WA 548/16-1, GRK 1591]; CNRS-University of Montpellier [UMR9002]; Association Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie [ANR-15-CE12-0019-01]; Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale (Equipe FRM) [DEQ20130326534]; Fondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le Cancer (ARC Libre) [3192]; Fondation ARC; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-15-CE12-0019] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); CNRS-University of Montpellier; Association Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale (Equipe FRM)(Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale); Fondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le Cancer (ARC Libre); Fondation ARC; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"We thank F.

Nb2O5 cylindrical pellets, 13 mm in diameter and 10 mm in length, were produced from powders using a cold isostatic press. The pellets were subsequently sintered at 1100 degrees C. A scratch was created in the sintered Nb2O5 pellets and was subsequently filled with Ag2O. The pellets were annealed to stimulate the self-healing process. X-ray diffraction was used to explore the evolution of phases, chemical compositions, and structural properties of the sintered samples before and after the stimulated-healing process. Energy dispersive Xray spectroscopy revealed the elemental composition in the healed region. The on-site composition of the healed sample was determined by Raman spectroscopy and was compared to the spectrum outside of the scratch. Raman spectroscopy confirmed that precipitation proceeded via the following chemical reaction which was facilitated at elevated temperature: Nb2O5 + Ag2O -> 2AgNbO(3). In addition, a 3D reconstructed stylus profilometry image of the crack region confirmed that healing occurred. Healing by recovering 89% of the original material strength was confirmed using the three-point bend test. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Gu, J. J.; Steiner, D.; Mogonye, J.

Freeze casting is used to obtain macropores. Alongside, highly bioactive 45S5 Bioglass, gelatin and chitosan are used as biocompatible binder and stabilizing agent, respectively. By varying the cooling rate between 2 and 4 K min(-1) and whether the slurry is allowed to form a gelled network at 7 degrees C before freeze casting or not, samples with a porosity of 75% are achieved. X-ray tomography analysis shows smallest pore sizes between 73 and 77 mu m and a rather lamellar structure parallel to the freezing direction for the non-gelled samples, whereas the gelled samples have smallest pores between 96 and 120 mu m and show a rather cellular structure. Compression tests reveal compressive strengths from 2 (non-gelled) to 3 MPa (gelled), while the quasielastic moduli of the gelled samples (44-46 MPa) clearly exceed values of the non-gelled (20-23 MPa). Thus, it is concluded that the modified pore structure caused by the gelling process markedly improves the mechanical properties of the samples. After seven days in SBF under physiological conditions, a calcium phosphate rich layer is detected on the samples surface, revealing the bioactivity of the scaffolds.","[Henning, Laura M.; Zavareh, Sara; Schmidt, Franziska; Gurlo, Aleksander] Tech Univ Berlin, Chair Adv Ceram Mat, Hardenbergstr 40, D-10623 Berlin, Germany; [Kamm, Paul H.; Banhart, John] Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin, Inst Appl Mat, Hahn Meitner Pl 1, D-14109 Berlin, Germany; [Hoener, Miriam; Fischer, Horst] Univ Klinikum RWTH Aachen, Dept Dent Mat & Biomat Res, Pauwelsstr 30, D-52074 Aachen, Germany",Technical University of Berlin; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum fuer Materialien und Energie GmbH (HZB); RWTH Aachen University; RWTH Aachen University Hospital,"Schmidt, F (corresponding author), Tech Univ Berlin, Chair Adv Ceram Mat, Hardenbergstr 40, D-10623 Berlin, Germany.",franziska.schmidt@ceramics.tu-berlin.de,"Kamm, Paul Hans/AAZ-6141-2021; Fischer, Horst/G-8449-2011; Schmidt, Franziska/I-2293-2019; Banhart, John/E-8694-2011","Henning, Laura M./0000-0003-3989-5908; Banhart, John/0000-0003-4480-7730; Kamm, Paul Hans/0000-0001-6353-768X; Schmidt, Franziska/0000-0003-4704-0467; Fischer, Horst/0000-0003-0990-5028; Gurlo, Aleksander/0000-0001-7047-666X",Technische Universitat Berlin,Technische Universitat Berlin,"We thank Clemens Randow and Prof. Dr. Claudia Fleck from Technische Universitat Berlin, Materials Engineering for their help provided in testing the mechanical properties.

CM photocatalysts were impregnated with TiO2 using titanium solution and thermal treatment, and their photocatalytic activity was investigated in the process of methylene blue (MB) photodegradation. For the purpose of comparison, CM composite photocatalysts were prepared by dip-coating method, which implies binder usage. The presence of TiO2 on CM carrier was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The sorption characteristics of CM and the role of adsorption in the overall process of MB removal were evaluated through amount of surface oxygen groups obtained by temperature-programmed desorption and specific surface area determined by BET method. CM has shown good adsorption properties toward MB due to high amount of surface oxygen groups and relatively high specific surface area. It was concluded that photocatalytic activity increases with CM disc thickness due to increase of MB adsorption and amount of deposited TiO2. Good photocatalytic activity achieved for samples obtained by thermal treatment is the result of better accessibility of MB solution to the TiO2 particles induced by binder absence.","[Maletic, Marina] Univ Belgrade, Fac Technol & Met, Innovat Ctr, Belgrade 11000, Serbia; [Vukcevic, Marija; Lausevic, Mila] Univ Belgrade, Fac Technol & Met, Belgrade 11001, Serbia; [Kalijadis, Ana; Lausevic, Zoran] Univ Belgrade, Vinca Inst Nucl Sci, Phys Lab, Belgrade 11001, Serbia",University of Belgrade; University of Belgrade; University of Belgrade,"Vukcevic, M (corresponding author), Univ Belgrade, Fac Technol & Met, POB 494, Belgrade 11001, Serbia.",marijab@tmf.bg.ac.rs,"Maletić, Marina/GLS-7992-2022; Vukčević, Marija/AAE-3169-2022","Kalijadis, Ana/0000-0002-6897-4691; Lausevic, Zoran/0000-0001-9263-223X; Maletic, Marina/0000-0002-4112-9316; Vukcevic, Marija/0000-0003-0416-0741","Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Serbia [172007, 45006]","Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Serbia(Ministry of Education, Science & Technological Development, Serbia)","The authors wish to thank the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Serbia for financial support through the project of Basic Research, no. 172007, and Physics and Chemistry with Ion Beams (III) no. 45006.",,31.0,2,2,1,11,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1687-8434,1687-8442,,ADV MATER SCI ENG,Adv.

Calculated hydrogen and carbon depth profiles showed surprisingly significant changes in concentrations in the near-surface region of the DLC coatings, particularly when implanted with Ag+ ions. Hydrogen accumulates up to 32 at.% and the minimum of the carbon distribution is shifted towards the surface which may be the cause of the surface smoothing effect.

We synthesized SiOC(E1) films at different oxygen gas flow rates and substrate temperatures by the atmospheric pressure plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition method from TrMS/02/He gases. Substrates were placed at a working distance of 10 mm between discharge electrode and substrate surface. Plasma emission is gradually weakened with an increase in oxygen gas flow rate, and excessive introduction of oxygen into the process caused the plasma to disappear. The SiOC(E1) films were composed of a number of particles; Their large size particles lead to an increasing deposition rate and the non -dense structure of the films. As the oxygen gas flow rate increased, the particle size was larger at 100 nm and related -OH peaks strongly observed. Carbon content of SiOC(E1) films decreased from 17% to only 1.8% with an increase in substrate temperature at 140 degrees C. In this paper, we report the characterization of SiOC(E1) films synthesized under atmospheric pressure PECVD method.","[Mori, Takanori; Masuko, Taiki; Shirakura, Akira; Suzuki, Tetsuya] Keio Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Kohoku Ku, 3-14-1 Hiyoshi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2238522, Japan",Keio University,"Mori, T (corresponding author), Keio Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Kohoku Ku, 3-14-1 Hiyoshi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2238522, Japan.",tmori1050@gmail.com,,"Mori, Takanori/0009-0009-9622-8926",,,,,34.0,6,6,0,12,SURFACE SCI SOC JAPAN,TOKYO,"HONGO CORP 402, 2-40-13 HONGO, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113-0033, JAPAN",1348-0391,,,E-J SURF SCI NANOTEC,e-J.

The results reveal a complex interplay between graded morphology, indentation depth, and calculated modulus and hardness values, which was elucidated through numerical simulations. First, it was experimentally shown how for small (1 mu m) indentations, large increases in modulus (up to +40%) and hardness (up to +93%) were obtained for graded composites with respect to their homogeneous counterparts, whereas at a larger indentation depth (20 mu m), the modulus and hardness of the graded and homogeneous composites did not substantially differ from each other and from those of the pure polymer. Then, through a material point method approach, experimental nanoindentation tests were successfully simulated, confirming the importance of the indentation depth and of the associated plastic zone as key factors for a more accurate design of graded polymer nanocomposites whose mechanical properties are able to fulfill the requirements encountered during operational life.","[Nardi, Tommaso; Manson, Jan -Anders E.; Leterrier, Yves] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Technol Composites & Polymeres, Stn 12, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Hammerquist, Chad; Nairn, John A.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Wood Sci & Engn, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Karimi, Ayat] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Phys Matiere Complexe, Lausanne, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Oregon State University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne,"Leterrier, Y (corresponding author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Technol Composites & Polymeres, Stn 12, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",yves.leterrier@epfl.ch,"Leterrier, Yves/I-7398-2013",,Swiss National Science Foundation [200020_155888]; National Institute of Food and Agriculture(NIFA) [2013-34638-21483]; United States Department of Agriculture(USDA); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [200020_155888] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF),Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); National Institute of Food and Agriculture(NIFA); United States Department of Agriculture(USDA)(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"The authors acknowledge the Swiss National Science Foundation (project 200020_155888) for financial support.

In this method, direct current (DC) glow discharge in the crossed E/H fields was used to activate the gas phase. The diamond coatings were deposited from the working gas mixture CH4/H-2 with addition of nitrogen in various concentrations. It was ascertained that addition of N-2 to the working gas mixture leads to reduction in the sizes of diamond grains as well as to the substantial decrease in the resistivity of the studied films. The electrophysical data are in good agreement with the changes induced by varying the N-2 content in the Raman scattering spectra. The increase in the N-2 concentration causes significant lowering of the crystalline diamond related peak and increase in the intensity of the peaks related to the sp(2)-bonded carbon. These changes in the spectra indicate significant disordering of the structure of prepared films and its uniformity in the nanodiamond film volume. With the great possibility, it is associated with a decrease in the sizes of diamond crystalline grains and tendency of NCD film to amorphization.","[Nasieka, Iu.; Strelchuk, V.; Stubrov, Yu.; Boyko, M.] NAS Ukraine, V Ye Lashkaryov Inst Semicond Phys, UA-03028 Kiev, Ukraine; [Dudnik, S.; Koshevoy, K.; Strel'nitskij, V.] Kharkov Phys & Technol Inst, Natl Sci Ctr, UA-61108 Kharkov, Ukraine",National Academy of Sciences Ukraine; Lashkaryov Institute of Semiconductor Physics; Kharkov Institute of Physics & Technology,"Nasieka, I (corresponding author), NAS Ukraine, V Ye Lashkaryov Inst Semicond Phys, 45 Pr Nauki, UA-03028 Kiev, Ukraine.",yunaseka@gmail.com,"Nasieka, Iurii/JFK-5448-2023","Strel'nitskij, Volodimir/0000-0001-6047-6981; Stubrov, Yurii/0000-0001-7059-9424; Dudnik, Stanislav/0000-0003-2074-4739; Nasieka, Iurii/0000-0002-3431-8856; Strelchuk, Viktor/0000-0002-6894-1742",,,,,24.0,4,4,0,4,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1687-4110,1687-4129,,J NANOMATER,J.

The samples were immersed in SBF from 3 to 7 days. The morphology and the chemistry of the HA/tricalcium phosphate coating were then analysed. Prior to immersion in SBF, the samples were sandblasted and acid etched to mimic the morphology and roughness of commercially available dental implants. The SBF aided in the formation of crystalline HA/tricalcium phosphate coatings on all the samples. The coatings were uniform and had roughness values higher than the underlying substrate. The highest roughness values for the coatings on the surfaces were obtained at 7 days of immersion in SBF with average S-a values of 2.9 +/- 0.2 mu m. The presence of HA/tricalcium phosphate on the surfaces was confirmed by the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS), the X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), and the Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) analysis.

These mixed thin films were grown on quartz substrates by dip coating and then sintered at 550 degrees C. The film properties were evaluated using an atomic force microscope and a UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer, and by performing X-ray diffraction measurements. The growth mechanism is changed by MgO in ZnO-MgO mixed MOD coating materials. Mg segregated to the surface side in the ZnO-MgO mixed thin film, and some of the segregated Mg formed ZnMgO. In addition, the grain size of ZnO-MgO mixed thin films increased with an increase in the amount of MgO additive. Therefore, it can be concluded that grain boundary segregation of Mg enhances crystal growth. This enhancement of crystal growth by the intentional addition of an impurity can be applied to improving the characteristics of other semiconductor materials.","[Nishimoto, Naoki; Yoshino, Katsumi] Shimane Inst Ind Technol, 1 Hokuryo, Matsue, Shimane 6900816, Japan; [Fujihara, Junko] Shimane Univ, Dept Legal Med, Fac Med, Izumo, Shimane 6938501, Japan; [Kitahara, Kuninori] Shimane Univ, Interdisciplinary Fac Sci & Engn, Matsue, Shimane 6908504, Japan",Shimane University; Shimane University,"Nishimoto, N (corresponding author), Shimane Inst Ind Technol, 1 Hokuryo, Matsue, Shimane 6900816, Japan.",nnishimoto@shimane-iit.jp,"NISHIMOTO, Naoki/ABW-2099-2022; FUJIHARA, Junko/V-7818-2019","NISHIMOTO, Naoki/0000-0002-5854-7848; FUJIHARA, Junko/0000-0001-5359-5181",,,,,19.0,11,11,0,7,SURFACE SCI SOC JAPAN,TOKYO,"HONGO CORP 402, 2-40-13 HONGO, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113-0033, JAPAN",1348-0391,,,E-J SURF SCI NANOTEC,e-J.

The surface morphologies of DLC-Cu thin films were characterized using scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Three-dimensional brain models were reconstructed using magnetic resonance imaging to simulate the electrosurgical operation. In adult rats, a monopolar electrosurgical instrument coated with the DLC-Cu thin film was used to generate lesions in the brain. Animals were sacrificed for evaluations on postoperative days 0, 2, 7, and 28. Data indicated that the temperature decreased significantly when minimally invasive electrosurgical instruments with nanostructure DLC-Cu thin films were used and continued to decrease with increasing film thickness. On the other hand, the DLC-Cu-treated device created a relatively small thermal injury area and lateral thermal effect in the brain tissues. These results indicated that the DLC-Cu thin film minimized excessive thermal injury and uniformly distributed the temperature in the brain. Taken together, our study results suggest that the DLC-Cu film on copper electrode substrates is an effective means for improving the performance of electrosurgical instruments.","[Ou, Keng-Liang; Chiang, Hsi-Jen; Cheng, Han-Yi] Taipei Med Univ, Grad Inst Biomed Mat & Tissue Engn, Taipei 110, Taiwan; [Ou, Keng-Liang; Lin, Li-Hsiang; Chiang, Hsi-Jen; Cheng, Han-Yi; Huang, Chiung-Fang] Taipei Med Univ, Res Ctr Biomed Devices & Prototyping Prod, Taipei 110, Taiwan; [Ou, Keng-Liang; Cheng, Han-Yi] Taipei Med Univ, Res Ctr Biomed Implants & Microsurg Devices, Taipei 110, Taiwan; [Ou, Keng-Liang] Taipei Med Univ, Shuang Ho Hosp, Dept Dent, Taipei 235, Taiwan; [Lin, Li-Hsiang; Chiang, Hsi-Jen] Taipei Med Univ, Coll Oral Med, Sch Dent, Taipei 110, Taiwan; [Chen, Shyuan-Yow] Cathay Gen Hosp, Dept Dent, Div Periodont, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Huang, Chiung-Fang] Taipei Med Univ, Coll Oral Med, Sch Dent Technol, Taipei 110, Taiwan",Taipei Medical University; Taipei Medical University; Taipei Medical University; Taipei Medical University; Shuang Ho Hospital; Taipei Medical University; Cathay General Hospital; Taipei Medical University,"Huang, CF (corresponding author), Taipei Med Univ, Res Ctr Biomed Devices & Prototyping Prod, Taipei 110, Taiwan.",chiung0102@tmu.edu.tw,"Lin, Ying-Chu/C-8679-2009",,"Department of Health, Executive Yuan, Taiwan [MOHW103-TDU-N-211-133001]; Health and Welfare Surcharge of Tobacco Products [MOHW103-TD-B-11101]; Taipei Medical University [102TMU-TMUH-18]","Department of Health, Executive Yuan, Taiwan; Health and Welfare Surcharge of Tobacco Products; Taipei Medical University","The authors would like to thank the Department of Health, Executive Yuan, Taiwan, under Contract no.

The results indicated that surface roughness and adhesion strength depended on wood species and the chemical composition of preservatives. Generally, waterborne wood preservatives increased the surface roughness of wood while the organic-based wood preservatives decreased it. The organic-based wood preservatives decreased adhesion but they increased gloss value. Wood preservatives did not affect the scratch resistance which was found to depend on properties of the coating.

The film of thickness 240 nm was grown on Si (100) substrate by DC reactive sputtering at an average deposition rate of similar to 8 nm/min. After deposition the samples were annealed for 1 h at 600 degrees C and 2 h at 700 degrees C in nitrogen ambient and vacuum furnace, respectively. Structural characterizations were performed by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The optical properties were investigated by spectroscopic ellipsometry while a four point probe was used for electrical characterization. It was found that the post-deposition annealing of the films did not cause any variation in stoichiometry, but strongly affects the structural parameters such as lattice constant, micro-strain and grain size. The observed increase in the grain size after annealing leads to significantly lower value of the coefficient of absorption. These changes could be directly correlated with variation of electrical properties of TiN thin films.","[Popovic, Maja; Novakovic, Mirjana; Bibic, Natasa] Univ Belgrade, Vinca Inst Nucl Sci, POB 522, Belgrade 11001, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Popovic, M (corresponding author), Univ Belgrade, Vinca Inst Nucl Sci, POB 522, Belgrade 11001, Serbia.",majap@vinca.rs,,"Novakovic, Mirjana/0000-0001-7103-0117; Popovic, Maja/0000-0002-0659-1732",Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Serbia [III 45005]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [436 SER 113/2],"Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Serbia(Ministry of Education, Science & Technological Development, Serbia); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG))",This work was supported by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Serbia (Project No. III 45005) and by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (Project 436 SER 113/2).,,25.0,18,19,0,29,"UNIV NOVI SAD, FAC TECHNOLOGY",NOVI SAD,"BUL CARA LAZARA 1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1820-6131,2406-1034,,PROCESS APPL CERAM,Process.

UV-VIS spectroscopy and ellipsometry were used to study the optical properties. The paper also presents results of electrical and dielectric measurements. We found out that the properties of all structures prepared by spin coating depend on the rotational speed of spin coater, on the mode of solution casting (static, dynamic) and in the case of material inkjet printing they are too much influenced by the substrate.

The anisotropic SmCo5 nanoscale chips were first prepared by surfactant-assisted ball milling then coated with soft magnetic FeCo using cobalt sulfate (CoSO4.7H(2)O) and iron sulfate (FeSO4.7H(2)O) as metal precursors in presence of complexing agents. The influence of the soft-phase coating on the magnetic properties of the nanocomposite particles has been studied. The saturation magnetization of the composite particles increases with increasing coating while the coercivity decreases. The FeCo coated chips have an enhanced remanence (M-r = 44.5 emu/g with 16 wt % of FeCo) compared to the uncoated chips (M-r = 36.7 emu/g), indicating exchange coupling between the hard and soft phases for the optimal soft-phase coating.

Therefore, we have constructed a cell-based, iterative screening system to examine a variety of nanoproducts concerning their toxicity during development. The sensitivity and application of various cell-based methods were discussed and proven by applying the screening to two different nanoparticles: zinc oxide and titanium dioxide nanoparticles. They were used as benchmarks to set up our methods and to examine their effects on mammalian cell lines. Different biological processes such as cell viability, gene expression of interleukin-8 and heat shock protein 70, as well as morphology changes were investigated. Within our screening system, both nanoparticle suspensions and coatings can be tested. Electric cell impedance measurements revealed to be a good method for online monitoring of cellular behavior. The implementation of three-dimensional cell culture is essential to better mimic in vivo conditions. In conclusion, our screening system is highly efficient, cost minimizing, and reduces the need for animal studies.","[Sambale, Franziska; Stahl, Frank; Ruedinger, Ferdinand; Bahnemann, Detlef; Scheper, Thomas] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Tech Chem, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; [Seliktar, Dror] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Biomed Engn, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel; [Kasper, Cornelia] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci Boku, Inst Appl Microbiol, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Bahnemann, Detlef] St Petersburg State Univ, Lab Photoact Nanocomposite Mat, St Petersburg 198504, Russia",Leibniz University Hannover; Technion Israel Institute of Technology; BOKU University; Saint Petersburg State University,"Stahl, F (corresponding author), Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Tech Chem, Callinstr 5, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",stahl@iftc.uni-hannover.de,"Kasper, Cornelia/AAC-1924-2022; Scheper, Thomas/H-8143-2013; Bahnemann, Detlef/G-3375-2012","Scheper, Thomas/0000-0003-1535-4584; Seliktar, Dror/0000-0001-6964-8567; Bahnemann, Detlef Werner/0000-0001-6064-6653; Stahl, Frank/0000-0001-7416-0806; kasper, cornelia/0000-0003-2607-4326",European Regional Development Fund (EFRE Project Nanokomp Grant) [60421066]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Open Access Publishing Fund of Leibniz Universitat Hannover,European Regional Development Fund (EFRE Project Nanokomp Grant)(European Union (EU)); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Open Access Publishing Fund of Leibniz Universitat Hannover,"This work was supported by the European Regional Development Fund (EFRE Project Nanokomp, Grant no. 60421066).

To determine the dependence of luminescence intensity on the thickness of solid coating, we carried out the formation of nanophotonic solid surfaces by means of screen printing with different layer thickness on polypropylene film. The obtained analytical dependencies were used to confirm the explanation of the processes that occur during the fabrication of nanophotonic coverings with offset gravure printing plates. As a result of experimental studies, it was determined that the different character of the dependency of total luminescence intensity of nanophotonic elements from the percentage of a pad is explained by the use of different types of offset gravure printing plates, where the size of raster points remains constant in one case and changes in the other case, while the depth of the printing elements accordingly changes or remains constant. To obtain nanophotonic areas with predetermined photoluminescent properties, the influence of investigated factors on changes of photoluminescent properties of nanophotonic printed surfaces should be taken into consideration.","[Sarapulova, Olha; Sherstiuk, Valentyn] Natl Tech Univ Ukraine Kyiv Polytech Inst, Publishing & Printing Inst, 1-37 Yangel St, UA-03056 Kiev, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute,"Sarapulova, O (corresponding author), Natl Tech Univ Ukraine Kyiv Polytech Inst, Publishing & Printing Inst, 1-37 Yangel St, UA-03056 Kiev, Ukraine.",olhasarapulova@gmail.com,"Hrytsenko, Olha/B-3820-2017","Hrytsenko, Olha/0000-0002-0897-1405",Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine [2873 p],Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine,The studies were conducted with the support of the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine (Grant 2873 p).,,8.0,1,1,0,1,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1687-9503,1687-9511,,J NANOTECHNOL,J.

The thickness of the NAAMs is adjusted by changing the second anodization time from 5 min to 20 min. The surface morphology, composition, and optical properties are characterized by using SEM, EDX, and spectrophotometer, respectively. The effects of the NAAM thickness and state of polarization on the morphological changes and on the optical properties of the fabricated nanoarrays were addressed. According to the measured optical spectra, the rate of decrease of NAAMs refractive index was found to be 3.825 x 10(-4) nm(-1). Using the modified Kubelka-Munk radiative transfer model, the energy gap of NAAMs was calculated from diffused reflectance and was decreased from 1.682 to 1.376 as the anodization time increased from 5 to 20 min. Also, the saturation of interference fringes is substantially enhanced, and field enhancement can be achieved due to the excitation and constructive interference of surface plasmon waves by coating NAAMs with the hexagonal nanoarrays of Au. Based on the advantages of the fabrication approach and the enhanced and controlled properties, this new generation of samples can be used as promising building blocks for nanophotonic and nanoelectronics devices.","[Shaban, Mohamed] Beni Suef Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Phys, Nanophoton & Applicat NPA Lab, Bani Suwayf 62514, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Beni Suef University,"Shaban, M (corresponding author), Beni Suef Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Phys, Nanophoton & Applicat NPA Lab, Salah Salem St, Bani Suwayf 62514, Egypt.",mssfadel@yahoo.com,"Shaban, Mohamed/Q-9198-2019",,Science and Technology Development Fund (STDF) Program of Egypt [4617],Science and Technology Development Fund (STDF) Program of Egypt(Science and Technology Development Fund (STDF)),This work was partially supported by the Science and Technology Development Fund (STDF) Program of Egypt (Grant no. 4617).,,28.0,8,8,0,20,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1687-4110,1687-4129,,J NANOMATER,J.

The crystallization behavior, mechanical properties, thermal dynamical mechanical analysis (DMTA), and the morphology of the PCC/PLA, HNT/PLA, and HNT/PCC/PLA composites were discussed. Compared to halloysite nanotubes, PCC nanoparticles showed a better nucleating effect, which decreased both the glass transition and cold crystallization temperatures. The tensile performance of PLA composites showed that the addition of inorganic nanofillers increased Young's modulus but decreased tensile strength. More interestingly, PLA composites with PCC particles exhibited an effectively increased elongation at break with respect to pure PLA, while HNT/PLA showed a decreased ultimate deformation of composites. DMTA results indicated that PLA composites had a similar storage modulus at temperatures below the glass transition and the addition of nanofillers into PLA caused T-g to shift to lower temperatures by about 3 degrees C. The morphological analysis of fractures surface of PLA nanocomposites showed good dispersion of nanofillers, formation of microvoids, and larger plastic deformation of the PLA matrix when the PCC particles were added, while a strong aggregation was noticed in composites with HNT nanofillers, which has been attributed to a nonoptimal surface coating.","[Shi, Xuetao; Zhang, Guangcheng] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Sci, Dept Appl Chem, Xian 710072, Peoples R China; [Shi, Xuetao; Lazzeri, Andrea] Univ Pisa, Dept Chem Engn Ind Chem & Mat Sci, I-56126 Pisa, Italy; [Siligardi, Cristina; Ori, Guido] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Chem, I-41100 Modena, Italy",Northwestern Polytechnical University; University of Pisa; Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia,"Shi, XT (corresponding author), Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Sci, Dept Appl Chem, Xian 710072, Peoples R China.",totalsxt@126.com; a.lazzeri@ing.unipi.it,"Siligardi, Cristina/Q-9408-2019; Shi, Xuetao/D-5180-2012; Ori, Guido/I-7606-2019; Siligardi, Cristina/O-4131-2015; Lazzeri, Andrea/I-9463-2014","Siligardi, Cristina/0000-0003-1642-832X; Lazzeri, Andrea/0000-0002-9463-1502; Ori, Guido/0000-0003-3336-8277",FP7 KBBE Project [212239]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51303149]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [3102014JC01095],FP7 KBBE Project; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),The authors wish to acknowledge the support from FP7 KBBE Project no. 212239 Forbioplast (Forest Resource Sustainability through Bio-Based Composite Development) and also the support from National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 51303149) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant no. 3102014JC01095).,,39.0,23,23,5,13,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1687-4110,1687-4129,,J NANOMATER,J.

In the solar cells, the antireflection layer plays an important role in the improvement in the conversion efficiency by increasing the light transmission and suppressing the Fresnel refraction. For the successful implantation of the antireflection layer into the flexible solar cells, the flexible mechanical property of the antireflection layer is also necessary. However, the study on flexible antireflection layer for the flexible solar cells or optoelectronics is still lacking. In this study, we report the graphene-tapered ZnO nanorods array as a flexible antireflection layer for the application in flexible solar cells.

The SEM observations revealed that the samples consist of 5-15 mu m Mg particles, surrounded and in some cases coated by carbon particles. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the Mg phase of all as-obtained composite powders is nanocrystalline with average crystallite size in the range 20-30 nm, depending on the milling conditions. The best hydriding properties, expressed in low-temperature hydriding (below 150 degrees C) and improved cycle life, showed the composites milled at dry conditions. This is obviously due mainly to the successful Mg surface protection by the carbon. Additional decrease of the hydriding temperature (<100 degrees C) was achieved applying higher-energy milling, but at the same time the cycling stability deteriorated, due to the extremely fine particles and microstructure achieved under these conditions. The composites milled in the presence of heptane showed rapid capacity decline during cycling as well. The observed difference in the hydriding behavior of the Mg-CB composites is attributed to the different coating efficiency of the carbon milled under different conditions with Mg, which is supposed to protect magnesium from oxidation and plays a catalytic role for the hydriding reaction.","[Stoyadinova, Hristina; Zlatanova, Zlatina; Spassova, Maya; Spassov, Tony] Univ Sofia St Kliment Ohridski, Fac Chem & Pharm, Sofia 1164, Bulgaria; [Baklanov, Mikhail] IMEC, Interuniv Microelect Ctr Leuven, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium",University of Sofia; Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre,"Spassov, T (corresponding author), Univ Sofia St Kliment Ohridski, Fac Chem & Pharm, 1 James Bourchier St, Sofia 1164, Bulgaria.",tspassov@chem.uni-sofia.bg,"Baklanov, Mikhail/D-4672-2016","Baklanov, Mikhail/0000-0002-9677-1293; Spassov, Tony/0000-0002-4568-9273; Spassova, Maya/0000-0002-0276-6478",COST Action [MP1103]; FP7 BeyondEverest project,COST Action(European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)); FP7 BeyondEverest project,The work has been supported by FP7 BeyondEverest project.

As a reference, LiMnPO4/C (LMP/C) composites were also fabricated via the traditional hydrothermal method. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), thermogravimetric analysis (TG), galvanostatic charge-discharge, and cyclic voltammetry (CV) were performed to characterize the crystalline phase, morphology, structure, carbon content, and electrochemical behaviors of samples. The electrochemical performance of bare and carbon-coated LiMnPO4 was evaluated as cathodes in lithium ion batteries. As a result, the obtained ULMP/C nanoplates demonstrated much higher reversible capacities (110.9 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles at 0.1 C) and rate performances than pure LMP and LMP/C composites.

Since the development of the spout fluidized bed, several geometrical modifications have been proposed to optimize the bed performance. One of these modifications often applied in granulation and coating industries includes a draft tube insertion inside the bed, which results in improved performance by providing a restriction on lateral particle flow providing clear distinction for wet spout and dry annulus zones. Moreover, the insertion of the draft tube leads to a stable spouting at lower flow rates, due to the reduced bypassing of the inlet gas (from spout to annulus). In this work, the hydrodynamic characteristics of a spout fluidized bed with draft plates was studied to identify the flow characteristics by constructing a flow regime map by image analysis and a fast Fourier transform of the measured pressure signal. In addition, the captured images were used to determine the particle velocity via particle image velocimetry (PIV). Furthermore, simulations were carried using a discrete particle model with a sub grid scale turbulence model for two regimes, namely the spouting-with-aeration and fluidized bed-spouting-with-aeration (dispersed spout), which are of most interest from an industrial view point. The obtained results were compared with previously obtained experimental data i.e. PIV. This study highlights various flow pattern observed during operation of spout fluidized bed with a draft plate over a wider operating conditions, which is useful to select proper operating conditions; whereas the experimental data can be used for computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model validation, which serve as a building block for design and scale-up at higher operational scales. Besides this, the quantitative information such as particle velocity, residence time distribution, solid mixing and circulation can be obtained after suitable post processing hence useful in optimizing the bed performance.

Corrosion tests in a chloride environment were carried out to determine resistance to localised attack, which was also verified on SEM/EDS. OCP transients confirmed an improved condition, that is, a more positive and stable potential after LSPwC treatment. Moreover, polarisation resistance of the LSPwC treated specimen was by a factor of 25 higher compared to the untreated specimen. Analysis of voltammograms confirmed an improved enhanced region of passivity and significantly smaller anodic current density of the LSPwC specimen compared to the untreated one. Through SEM, reduction of pitting attack at the LSPwC specimen surface was confirmed, despite its increased roughness.","[Trdan, U.; Grum, J.] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Mech Engn, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Trdan, U (corresponding author), Univ Ljubljana, Fac Mech Engn, Askerceva Cesta 6, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",uros.trdan@fs.uni-lj.si,,"Trdan, Uros/0000-0002-0688-2919; Grum, Janez/0000-0003-3190-614X",,,,,39.0,29,30,4,27,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1687-8434,1687-8442,,ADV MATER SCI ENG,Adv.

Thus, the aim of this work was to check whether, by the deposition of a thin, hard, low-friction coating on the teeth flanks of spiral bevel gears, it is possible to improve the resistance to wear, reduce friction and possibly the gear vibrations. The tribological experiments were carried out in two phases. In the first phase, a bevel gear test rig was used (laboratory testing). In the second phase, a verification test was performed using an industrial gear stand (chain conveyor) working under conditions typical of coal mines. The low-friction WC/C coating was tested. The coating was deposited on the teeth of the wheels. For reference, the uncoated pairs of spiral bevel gears were tested. In the laboratory testing, a commercial, mineral automotive gear oil of the API GL-5 performance level and 80W-90 viscosity grade was used for lubrication. For lubrication of the industrial gears, a mineral base oil of the low, VG32 viscosity grade was chosen. The results obtained show that, by the deposition of the low-friction WC/C coating on the teeth of the wheel, the following beneficial effects can be achieved in comparison with the case of the uncoated gears: a rise in the resistance to the two forms of severe wear (scuffing and pitting), and a drop in the oil temperature (lower friction) at first tests stages. The above effects are accompanied at the first stages of the tests by an undesired, higher level of vibrations in case of the steel-WC/C material combination. However, throughout the test, the vibrations for the two material combinations became similar. Thus, the WC/C coating can be applied to increase the wear resistance and decrease the oil temperature in the transmissions containing spiral bevel gears in, e.g., chain conveyors installed in coal mines.","[Tuszynski, Waldemar; Kalbarczyk, Marek; Michalak, Michal; Michalczewski, Remigiusz] Natl Res Inst ITeE PIB, Inst Sustainable Technol, Tribol Dept, PL-26600 Radom, Poland; [Wieczorek, Andrzej] Silesian Tech Univ, Fac Min & Geol, PL-44100 Gliwice, Poland",Institute for Sustainable Technologies; Silesian University of Technology,"Tuszynski, W (corresponding author), Natl Res Inst ITeE PIB, Inst Sustainable Technol, Tribol Dept, Pulaskiego 6-10, PL-26600 Radom, Poland.",waldemar.tuszynski@itee.radom.pl,"Wieczorek, Andrzej/ADA-8626-2022; Michalczewski, Remigiusz/N-3394-2019; Michalak, Michał/I-4215-2016","Kalbarczyk, Marek/0000-0003-0286-5705; Michalczewski, Remigiusz/0000-0002-9199-616X; WIECZOREK, ANDRZEJ/0000-0002-8634-7763",,,,,23.0,15,15,0,24,KAUNAS UNIV TECH,KAUNAS,"KAUNAS UNIV TECH MATERIALS SCIENCE, K DONELAICIO G 73, KAUNAS, LT 44029, LITHUANIA",1392-1320,2029-7289,,MATER SCI-MEDZG,Mater.

The effect of inhibitor on the deposition process and corrosion behavior was also examined. Materials characterization was performed using field emission scanning electron microscopy, cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, x-ray diffraction and nanoindentation. Experimental results indicated that pulse electrodeposition produced fine grained Ni coatings that showed lower corrosion rate compared to coarse grained dc electrodeposited Ni. Pretreatment of substrates with inhibitor did not adversely affect the deposition process and adherent Ni coatings were readily developed. The results showed that pulse electrodeposition could be used to produce hard corrosion resistant Ni coatings while the inhibitor treatment yielded enhanced corrosion protection by providing a protective buffer layer between the Ni coating and the substrate.","[Ul-Hamid, Anwar; Quddus, Abdul; Saricimen, Huseyin; Dafalla, Hatim] King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Res Inst, Ctr Engn Res, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia",King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals,"Ul-Hamid, A (corresponding author), King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Res Inst, Ctr Engn Res, POB 1524, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia.",amquddus@kfupm.edu.sa,"Qadeer, Abdul/HND-3667-2023; Dafalla, Hatim/J-4819-2013; Ul-Hamid, Anwar/B-7297-2015","Ul-Hamid, Anwar/0000-0002-0259-301X","Research Institute at the King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia","Research Institute at the King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia","The authors wish to acknowledge the support of the Research Institute at the King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.",,22.0,15,19,0,20,"UNIV FED SAO CARLOS, DEPT ENGENHARIA MATERIALS",SAO CARLOS,"LABORATORIA DE MATERIAIS VITREOS, CAIXA POSTAL 676, SAO CARLOS, 13565-905SP, BRAZIL",1516-1439,1980-5373,,MATER RES-IBERO-AM J,Mater.

The results show that the film coated lactose-based tablets contained viable bacteria and the survival rate after the process was 21 %, which could be enhanced up to 59 % by applying protective media (trehalose, sucrose, reconstituted skim milk (RSM)) during dehydration. Additionally, protective agents improved the viability of bacteria during storage too. After one year, 20 % of the embedded bacteria were active when stored at -20 degrees C, and viability dropped only one order of magnitude when stored at 7 degrees C. It was verified that the bacteria in film coated tablets were not sensitive to higher levels of humidity owing to the moisture-moderating polyvinyl alcohol-based coating composite. The described technology for production of tablets containing living bacteria by tablet coating seems industrially feasible as tablet film coaters are widespread in the pharmaceutical industry.","[Wagner, Istvan; Nagy, Zsombor Kristof; Pataki, Hajnalka; Soti, Peter; Vigh, Tamas; Balogh, Attila; Marosi, Gyoergy] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Fac Chem Technol & Biotechnol, Dept Organ Chem & Technol, H-1521 Budapest, Hungary; [Suhajda, Agnes; Harasztos, Anna Helga] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Fac Chem Technol & Biotechnol, Dept Appl Biotechnol & Food Sci, H-1521 Budapest, Hungary",Budapest University of Technology & Economics; Budapest University of Technology & Economics,"Wagner, I (corresponding author), Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Fac Chem Technol & Biotechnol, Dept Organ Chem & Technol, H-1521 Budapest, Hungary.",istvanwagner@gmail.com,"Pataki, Hajnalka/LZH-6146-2025; Vigh, Tamas/B-9059-2013; Nagy, Zsombor/I-5009-2012","Vigh, Tamas/0000-0003-1251-5848; Nagy, Zsombor/0000-0003-2651-7756",New Szechenyi Plan [TAMOP-4.2.1/B-09/1/KMR-2010-0002]; OTKA [PD-108975]; Richter Gedeon Talentum foundation,New Szechenyi Plan; OTKA(Orszagos Tudomanyos Kutatasi Alapprogramok (OTKA)); Richter Gedeon Talentum foundation,This project was supported by the New Szechenyi Plan (project ID: TAMOP-4.2.1/B-09/1/KMR-2010-0002) and OTKA grant PD-108975.

A kind of porous metal-entangled titanium (Ti) wire material was treated with MAO process, resulting in a homogeneous rough TiO2 layer, which helped facilitate MG-63 cell growth, cell viability, early cell differentiation, and cell mineralization in vitro. In addition, the MAO-treated Ti surfaces could promote the proliferation of MG-63 cells without sacrificing differentiation in vitro, which would benefit de novo bone formation around MAO-treated titanium at the early stage. The transcription levels of the extracellular matrix genes of osterix (OSX), collagen type I (Col I), bone sialoprotein (BSP), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin (OC) and osteopontin (OPN) and their protein expression levels were measured, suggesting that the cocultured cells with MAO titanium maintained the osteoblastic phenotype and that the MAO-treated titanium surface greatly stimulated osteoblast cell proliferation and differentiation compared to the untreated titanium.

The structure and properties of the composites were characterized by zeta potential, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Fourier transforminfrared spectrometer (FTIR), microcalorimeter (MCC), and so forth. The zeta potential results show that the cellulose microcrystalline surface charge reversed due to the adsorption of CH and MMT nanoplatelets during multilayer deposition. MMT characteristic diffraction peaks appear in XRD patterns of SFCM(CH/MMT)(5) and SFCM(CH/MMT)(10) composites. Additionally, FESEM reveals that the SFCM(CH/MMT)(10) surface is covered with a layer of material containing Si, which has been verified by elemental analysis. TGA results show that the initial decomposition (weight loss of 5%) temperature of SFCM(CH/MMT)(5) is increased by 4 degrees C compared to that of pure SFCM. On the other hand, carbon residue percentage of SFCM(CH/MMT)(10) is 25.1%, higher than that of pure SFCM (5.4%) by 19.7%.

The viscosity versus concentration curve for Ag-EG dispersions showed a viscosity minimum at a silver concentration between 2.2 vol.% and 2.9 vol.%; this is indicative of the transition to an entirely liquid crystalline phase. The rheology results were consistent with optical microscopy observations that at 2.9 vol.% the sample was entirely birefringent; this is another indication of liquid crystalline phase formation.

The mechanical properties of SWCNT-Ni and SWCNT were calculated and analyzed at different temperatures in the range from 220K to 1200K. From the MD results, temperature was determined to be the crucial factor affecting the mechanical properties of SWCNT-Ni and SWCNT. After coating nickel atoms onto the surface of a SWCNT, the Young's modulus, tensile strength, and tensile failure strain of SWCNT were greatly reduced with temperature rising, indicating that the nickel atoms on the surface of SWCNT degrade its mechanical properties. However, at high temperature, the Young's modulus of both the SWCNT and the SWCNT-Ni exhibited significantly greater temperature sensitivity than at low temperatures, as the mechanical properties of SWCNT-Ni were primarily dominated by temperature and C-Ni interactions. During these stretching processes at different temperatures, the nickel atoms on the surface of SWCNT-Ni could obtain the amount of energy sufficient to break the C-C bonds as the temperature increases.","[Zhu, Fulong; Tang, Kai; Chen, Youkai; Liu, Sheng] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Mech Sci & Engn, Inst Microsyst, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Liao, Hengyou] Dongfang Elect Machinery Co Ltd, Deyang 618000, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology,"Zhu, FL (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Mech Sci & Engn, Inst Microsyst, 1037 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.",zhufulong@hust.edu.cn,"Liu, Sheng/T-8821-2019","Liu, Sheng/0000-0001-6033-078X","973 project [2015CB057203]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [HUST: 2011TS066, 2013TS023]",973 project(National Basic Research Program of China); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This work is supported by 973 project (no. 2015CB057203) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, HUST: 2011TS066, 2013TS023.

The results show that a continuous and uniform coating with a certain thickness (around 3.5 mu m) can be formed on the surface of SiCp. With the addition of the Ni layer, there are some intermetallics Ni3Al but no interfacial carbide Al4C3, which improves the wettability and the thermal conductivity of the composites.

The effect of the gradual substitution of Sb by Ru in the nominal composition on the physicochemical and electrochemical properties were evaluated. The electrochemical stability of the electrodes was estimated from accelerated tests at 0.5 A cm(-2) in 1 M NaOH. Both as-synthesized and deactivated electrodes were thoroughly characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). The incorporation of a small amount (about 3 at. %) of both Pt and Ru into the SnO2-Sb electrodes produced a 400-times increase in their service life in alkaline medium, with no remarkable change in the electrocatalysis of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It is concluded that the deactivation of the electrodes is promoted by alkaline dissolution of metal species and coating detachment at high potentials. The introduction of Pt has a coating compacting effect, and Ru(IV), at low amounts until 9.75 at. %, replaces the Sn(IV) cations in the rutile-like SnO2 structure to form a solid solution that strongly increases the stability of the electrodes. The observed Ru segregation and decreased stability for larger Ru contents (x > 9.75 at. %), together with the selective dissolution of Ru after deactivation, suggest that the formation of a homogeneous (Ru delta Sn1-delta)O-2 single-phase is crucial for the stabilization of these electrodes.","[Berenguer, Raul] Univ Malaga, Dept Ingn Quim, Andalucia Tech, E-29071 Malaga, Spain; [Manuel Sieben, Juan] Univ Nacl Sur, Inst Ingn Electroquim & Corros, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Manuel Sieben, Juan] Univ Nacl Sur, CONICET, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Quijada, Cesar] Univ Politecn Valencia, Dept Ingn Text & Papelera, E-03801 Alcoy, Alicante, Spain; [Morallon, Emilia] Univ Alicante, Dept Quim Fis, E-03080 Alicante, Spain; [Morallon, Emilia] Univ Alicante, Inst Univ Mat, E-03080 Alicante, Spain",Universidad de Malaga; National University of the South; Instituto de Investigaciones en Ingenieria Electrica (IIIE); Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); National University of the South; Instituto de Investigaciones en Ingenieria Electrica (IIIE); Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; Universitat d'Alacant; Universitat d'Alacant,"Morallón, E (corresponding author), Univ Alicante, Dept Quim Fis, Apartado 99, E-03080 Alicante, Spain.",morallon@ua.es,"Quijada, Cesar/D-2129-2010; Morallon, Emilia/A-7632-2013; Berenguer Betrian, Raul/F-5381-2016","Morallon, Emilia/0000-0003-4748-8747; Berenguer Betrian, Raul/0000-0002-8627-4939; Quijada, Cesar/0000-0002-9965-9651","MINECO; FEDER; Generalitat Valenciana [MAT2013-42007-P, PROMETEO2013/028]",MINECO(Spanish Government); FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government); Generalitat Valenciana(Center for Forestry Research & Experimentation (CIEF)),"The authors thank the MINECO, FEDER, and Generalitat Valenciana for the financial support (MAT2013-42007-P, PROMETEO2013/028 projects).",,61.0,71,74,4,197,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1944-8244,1944-8252,,ACS APPL MATER INTER,ACS Appl.

Spin-coated films were characterized with FT-IR, and once exposed to an aqueous solution the film distends and starts acting as a membrane which controls the flow of ions and H-2 gas. Electrochemical measurements (linear sweep voltammograms, open-circuit potential, and polarization) show that by altering the CA:PDMAEMA ratio the dissolution rate of Mg can be controlled. Such a control over Mg dissolution is crucial if Mg is to be considered as a viable, temporary biomedical implant material. Furthermore, the accumulation of corrosion products between the membrane and the sample diminishes the undesirable effects of high local pH and H-2 formation which takes place during the corrosion process.","[Yliniemi, Kirsi; Wilson, Benjamin.

However, the influence of feedstock characteristics on photocatalytic activity has hardly been addressed. This study was undertaken to prepare TiO2 photocatalytic coatings by APS from different feedstocks. The feedstocks were obtained by spray drying suspensions of a nano- and a submicron-sized TiO2 powder, with different solids contents and/or ratios of the nano- to submicron-sized particles. All the resulting powders were fully characterised to assess their suitability for use in APS processes. Feedstock powders were then deposited on steel coupons by APS using hydrogen or helium as secondary plasma gas. Coating microstructure and phase composition were characterised. Coating photocatalytic activity was determined by measuring the degradation of methylene blue dye in an aqueous solution. Powder characterisation showed that all feedstocks met plasma spray operation requirements with regard to agglomerate size distribution and density, as well as to powder flowability. Optimum agglomerate density was obtained when a well-balanced mixture of nano- and subrnicronsized particles was used. All coatings displayed a bimodal microstructure with partially melted agglomerates that retained the initial nano- or submicron-sized structure and composition (anatase phase) of the feedstock, surrounded by a fully melted matrix mainly formed by ruffle. As expected, coating porosity as well as the amount of partially melted areas depended strongly on plasma spray conditions and on feedstock characteristics. With regard to photocatalytic activity, a reasonably good fit of a first-order kinetic model to the experimental data was found for all coatings. The kinetic constants obtained displayed higher values than those of a commercial sol-gel coating. The values of these constants were related to feedstock characteristics as well as to plasma spraying conditions on the basis of anatase content. The contribution of other factors to the resulting coating surface is also discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

However, the bone-forming capacity of these constructs (seeded with or without cells) is so far not apparent. In this study, we aimed at developing a mineralizing culture condition to biofunctionalize three-dimensional (3D) porous scaffolds with highly mineralized ECM in order to produce devitalized, osteoinductive mineralized carriers for human periosteal-derived progenitors (hPDCs). For this, three medium formulations [i.e., growth medium only (BM1), with ascorbic acid (BM2), and with ascorbic acid and dexamethasone (BM3)] supplemented with calcium (Ca2+) and phosphate (PO43-) ions simultaneously as mineralizing source were investigated. The results showed that, besides the significant impacts on enhancing cell proliferation (the highest in BM3 condition), the formulated mineralizing media differentially regulated the osteochondro-related gene markers in a medium-dependent manner (e.g., significant upregulation of BMP2, bone sialoprotein, osteocalcin, and Wnt5a in BM2 condition). This has resulted in distinguished cell populations that were identifiable by specific gene signatures as demonstrated by the principle component analysis. Through devitalization, mineralized carriers with apatite crystal structures unique to each medium condition (by X-ray diffraction and SEM analysis) were obtained. Quantitatively, BM3 condition produced carriers with the highest mineral and collagen contents as well as human-specific VEGF proteins, followed by BM2 and BM1 conditions. Encouragingly, all mineralized carriers (after reseeded with hPDCs) induced bone formation after 8 weeks of subcutaneous implantation in nude mice models, with BM2-carriers inducing the highest bone volume, and the lowest in the BM3 condition (as quantitated by nano-computed tomography [nano-CT]). Histological analysis revealed different bone formation patterns, either bone ossicles containing bone marrow surrounding the scaffold struts (in BM2) or bone apposition directly on the struts' surface (in BM1 and BM3). In conclusion, we have presented experimental data on the feasibility to produce devitalized osteoinductive mineralized carriers by functionalizing 3D porous scaffolds with an in vitro cell-made mineralized matrix under the mineralizing culture conditions.","[Chai, Yoke Chin; Bolander, Johanna; Luyten, Frank P.] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Skeletal Biol & Engn Res Ctr, Tissue Engn Lab, Leuven, Belgium; [Chai, Yoke Chin] Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Dept Biomed Engn, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Chai, Yoke Chin; Geris, Liesbet; Bolander, Johanna; Pyka, Grzegorz; Van Bael, Simon; Luyten, Frank P.; Schrooten, Jan] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Div Skeletal Tissue Engn, Prometheus, Leuven, Belgium; [Geris, Liesbet] Univ Liege, Biomech Res Unit, Liege, Belgium; [Pyka, Grzegorz; Schrooten, Jan] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Mat Engn, Heverlee, Belgium; [Van Bael, Simon] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Mech Engn, Div Prod Engn Machine Design & Automat, Heverlee, Belgium",KU Leuven; Universiti Malaya; KU Leuven; University of Liege; KU Leuven; KU Leuven,"Schrooten, J (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Mat Engn, Div Skeletal Tissue Engn, Prometheus, Kasteelpark Arenberg 44 Bus 2450, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium.",jan.schrooten@mtm.kuleuven.be,"Bolander, Johanna/AAB-3461-2021; Luyten, Frank/GPS-7793-2022; geris, liesbet/D-2343-2016","Bolander, Johanna/0000-0002-6915-9509; geris, liesbet/0000-0002-8180-1445",Research Foundation-Flanders [FWO: 1.5.172.13N-Interdisc]; FWO-ENDEAVOUR [G.0982.11N]; Government Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology [IWT-111545],Research Foundation-Flanders(FWO); FWO-ENDEAVOUR; Government Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology,"The authors thank Kathleen Bosmans and Carla Geeroms for their assistance on the subcutaneous implantation.

Then, the FNPs-PEG was loaded with perindopril erbumine (PE), an antihypertensive compound to form a new nanocomposite (FPEGPE). Transmission electron microscopy results showed that there are no significant differences between the sizes of FNPs and FPEGPE nanocomposite. The existence of PEG-PE was supported by the FTIR and TGA analyses. The PE loading (10.3 %) and the release profiles from FPEGPE nanocomposite were estimated using ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy which showed that up to 60.8 and 83.1 % of the adsorbed drug was released in 4223 and 1231 min at pH 7.4 and 4.8, respectively. However, the release of PE was completed very fast from a physical mixture (FNPs-PEG-PE) after 5 and 7 min at pH 4.8 and 7.4, respectively, which reveals that the release of PE from the physical mixture is not in the sustained-release manner. Cytotoxicity study showed that free PE presented slightly higher toxicity than the FNPs and FPEGPE nanocomposite. Therefore, the decrease toxicity against mouse normal fibroblast (3T3) cell lines prospective of this nanocomposite together with controlled-release behavior provided evidence of the possible beneficial biological activities of this new nanocomposite for nanopharmaceutical applications for both oral and non-oral routes.","[Dorniani, Dena; Bin Hussein, Mohd Zobir] Univ Putra Malaysia, Inst Adv Technol ITMA, MSCL, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Kura, Aminu Umar; Fakurazi, Sharida; Ahmad, Zalinah] Univ Putra Malaysia, Vaccines & Immunotherapeut Lab IBS, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Shaari, Abdul Halim] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Sci, Dept Phys, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Ahmad, Zalinah] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Chem Pathol Unit, Dept Pathol, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia",Universiti Putra Malaysia; Universiti Putra Malaysia; Universiti Putra Malaysia; Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Bin Hussein, MZ (corresponding author), Univ Putra Malaysia, Inst Adv Technol ITMA, MSCL, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia.",dena_dorniani@yahoo.com; aminuukura@yahoo.com; mzobir@upm.edu.my; sharida@upm.edu.my; ahalim@upm.edu.my; zalinah@upm.edu.my,,"shaari, abdul halim/0000-0001-6729-630X; FAKURAZI, SHARIDA/0000-0001-8986-876X","Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation of Malaysia (MOSTI) under National Nanotechnology Initiative [NND/NA/(1)/TD11-010, 5489100]","Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation of Malaysia (MOSTI) under National Nanotechnology Initiative","The authors would like to thank the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation of Malaysia (MOSTI) under National Nanotechnology Initiative, Grant NND/NA/(1)/TD11-010 (Vot No. 5489100) for supporting this research.",,56.0,25,27,1,62,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0022-2461,1573-4803,,J MATER SCI,J.

The welding technology of applying alloy and composite coatings is widely used. The technology of infrasound thermal spraying of metal matrix composite coatings was presented. It is a simple technology and a very useful one in ship machinery regeneration during the cruise craft (e.g. internal combustion engines, torque pumps, separators). The metal matrix composite coatings must undergo finishing due to high surface roughness after application. Coatings obtained by thermal spraying have a large surface roughness, it is therefore necessary to make finishing coatings. Due to economic and technological developments it is essential that the coating was thin, abrasion-resistant, high smoothness, and the finishing was of chip that is not cause material loss. In order to ensure quality of technology offered the elements of the of machines used in shipbuilding of cold working by rolling, with small values of strain ratio, ultimately as a finishing alloy and composite coating is planned to use surface plastic forming of machine parts.","[Dyl, T.] Gdynia Maritime Univ, Fac Marine Engn, Dept Marine Mat & Technol, Gdynia, Poland",Gdynia Maritime University,"Dyl, T (corresponding author), Gdynia Maritime Univ, Fac Marine Engn, Dept Marine Mat & Technol, Gdynia, Poland.",dylu@am.gdynia.pl,,,,,,,11.0,2,2,0,2,DE GRUYTER OPEN LTD,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A ST, 01-811 WARSAW, POLAND",2083-4799,,,ADV MATER SCI,Adv.

Corrosion products were analyzed by XRD and SEM. Results show that the presence of coating could improve the corrosion resistance of stainless steel. FeAl phase appeared after VA at 600 degrees C, which enhanced cohesive force between the coating and the substrate, and reduced the oxidation and sulfidation rate. PO treatment can protect the substrate more effectively than VA treatment for metastable Al2O3 formed during PO treatment can be translated to stable Al2O3 more quickly at high-temperatures. The corrosion products of the two kinds of specimens with aluminum coating were both composed of Al2O3, a little amount of FeS and Fe2O3 after 24 h corrosion. Al2O3 was formed mainly in the coatings, FeS was mainly distributed in the interface between coating and substrate of the specimens, and a small amount of FeS was distributed in the substrate.

The second layer in the layered bond coat and the top coat were formed by air plasma spray (APS) process using nickel-based metallic feedstock and 8wt% yttria-stabilized zirconia, respectively. The CTF tests were performed till 872 cycles with a dwell time of 60 min at a surface temperature of 1100 degrees C and a bottom temperature of 950 degrees C. Also, the TS tests were conducted until 300 cycles with a dwell time of 60 min at 1100 degrees C.

The major characteristics indexes for performance selected to evaluate the processes are corrosion potential (Ecorr), corrosion current density (Icorr) and wear. Among the corresponding four process parameters the first three are coating parameters, viz. concentration of nickel sulphate, concentration of sodium hypophosphite, concentration of copper sulphate and the fourth one is post deposition heat treatment temperature. Methods: The corrosion property, i.e. Ecorr and Icorr, has been studied by potentiodynamic polarization test and the wear is measured in terms of wear depth by DUCOM TR-25 multi-tribotester with block on roller arrangement. Results: In this study, the process is intrinsically combined with multiple performance indexes so that grey relational analysis is specially adopted to determine the optimal combination of coating parameters. Moreover, the weighted principal component analysis (WPCA) is applied to evaluate the weighting values corresponding to various performance characteristics so that their relative importance can be properly and objectively described. Conclusion: From the analysis the optimum combination of parameters for corrosion property and the optimum combination of parameters for corrosion and wear together are obtained. The chemical composition, surface morphology and phase behaviour are investigated using energy dispersive X-ray analysis, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis, respectively.","[Roy, Supriyo; Sahoo, Prasanta] Jadavpur Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Kolkata 700032, India",Jadavpur University,"Sahoo, P (corresponding author), Jadavpur Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Kolkata 700032, India.",psjume@gmail.com,"Roy, Supriyo/H-4159-2019; Sahoo, Prasanta/H-4536-2019","Roy, Supriyo/0000-0001-8731-0068",,,,,39.0,10,11,0,0,SPRINGER SINGAPORE PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"#04-01 CENCON I, 1 TANNERY RD, SINGAPORE 347719, SINGAPORE",1823-0334,2198-2791,,INT J MECH MATER ENG,Int.

The alumina powders were plasma sprayed on AZ31B magnesium alloy with three different plasma spraying parameters. In the present work, the influence of plasma spray parameters on the corrosion behavior of the coatings was investigated. The corrosion behavior of the coated samples was evaluated by immersion corrosion test in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution. Empirical relationship was established to predict the corrosion rate of plasma sprayed alumina coatings by incorporating process parameters. The experiments were conducted based on a three factor, five-level, central composite rotatable design matrix. The developed relationship can be effectively used to predict the corrosion rate of alumina coatings at 95% confidence level. The results indicate that the input power has the greatest influence on corrosion rate, followed by stand-off distance and powder feed rate.

The overall effect was a combination of hardness and resistance to wear. PEO voltage level was found to be a factor decisive for the oxide layer thickness and level of porosity. In turn the latter two factors appeared to act upon the degree of hardening corundum to alumina fraction in the layer and the degree of Cr/Ni penetration into the oxide layer itself. The optimum condition of increased micro-hardness and high resistance to wear was achieved for an AlCu4Mg2 alloy of extended oxide layer thickness and intermediate levels of open porosity.

In this paper, the heterojunction SnO2/Al2O3 is tested concerning its use as a transparent insulating layer for use in FETs. The alumina layer is obtained by thermal annealing of metallic Al layer, deposited by resistive evaporation technique. Combination of undoped SnO2, deposited by sol-gel-dip-coating technique, and Al thermally annealed in O-2-rich atmosphere, leads to fair insulation when the number of aluminum oxide layers is 4, with 0.3% of the current lost through the gate terminal as leakage current. This insulation is not obtained for devices with alumina layer treated for long time, under room atmosphere, due to degradation of the insulating film and interfusion with the conduction channel even using Sb-doped SnO2. The annealing of Al deposited on soda-lime glass substrate leads also to the formation of a Si layer, crystallized at Substrate/Al2O3 interface. The conclusion is that for an efficient insulation the thermal annealing must be short and then, O-2-rich atmospheres are preferred.","[Boratto, Miguel Henrique; de Andrade Scalvi, Luis Vicente] Sao Paulo State Univ UNESP, FC, Dept Phys, Bauru, SP, Brazil; [Barbosa Maciel, Jorge Luiz, Jr.; Floriano, Emerson Aparecido] Sao Paulo State Univ UNESP, Postgrad Program Mat Sci & Technol, Bauru, SP, Brazil; [Barbosa Maciel, Jorge Luiz, Jr.] Euripides Soares Rocha Univ UNIVEM, Marilia, SP, Brazil; [Saeki, Margarida Juri] Sao Paulo State Univ UNESP, IBB, Dept Chem & Biochem, Botucatu, SP, Brazil",Universidade Estadual Paulista; Universidade Estadual Paulista; Universidade Estadual Paulista,"Boratto, MH (corresponding author), Sao Paulo State Univ UNESP, FC, Dept Phys, Bauru, SP, Brazil.",scalvi@fc.unesp.br,"Saeki, Margarida/AFR-3597-2022; Floriano, Emerson/K-2831-2012; Scalvi, Luis/I-5716-2012; Boratto, Miguel Henrique/P-3397-2017","Scalvi, Luis/0000-0001-5762-6424; Boratto, Miguel Henrique/0000-0001-7055-0751",Brazilian agency CNPq; Brazilian agency FAPESP; Brazilian agency FUNDUNESP [91312/13-DFP],Brazilian agency CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Brazilian agency FAPESP(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); Brazilian agency FUNDUNESP,"The authors would like to thank Prof. A.

The AAA was sputtered in argon and oxygen plasma mixtures. It was investigated the effect of the oxygen proportion (O-2 %) on the properties of the coatings. Deposition rate was derived from the layer height measured by profilometry. The elemental composition and molecular structure of the films were determined by Rutherford backscattering and infrared spectroscopies, respectively. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction was used to investigate the microstructure of the films while hardness was determined by nanoindentation technique. Inspections on the surface morphology and on the film composition were conducted associating scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy. Incorporation of oxygen affects the plasma kinetics and consequently the properties of the coatings. As moderated concentrations of oxygen (<25%) are added, the structure is predominantly organic containing stoichiometric amorphous alumina. On the other hand, as high O-2 % (> 25%) are incorporated, the structure become rich in metallic aluminum with carbon rising at low proportions. The deposited layer is not homogeneous in thickness once the chemical composition of the precursor is changed by the action of the reactive oxygen plasma. Oxygen ablation on the film surface also contributes to the lack of homogeneity of the structure, especially as high oxygen proportions are imposed. Hardness data (0.5-2.0 GPa) corroborated the idea of an amorphous structure.

Still, the proper control of the electrodeposition parameters is a must in order to obtain the best microhardness and corrosion behavior of such nanocomposite coating. This paper proposes the comparative analysis between Ni/diamond nanocomposite coatings, prepared by electrodeposition, by varying several deposition parameters and the corresponding pure nickel coatings onto the same type of substrate, namely copper. Microstructural and morphological analysis of the two kinds of coatings are also performed and studied, along with microhardness measurements and corrosion resistance tests.

The results showed that the samples coated with nanoceramics presented contact angles greater than 100 degrees, achieving hydrophobic behavior. Evaluating the electrochemical behavior under dynamic polarization revealed that the nanoceramic coating containing chromium (CHT) exhibited a higher corrosion potential and lower current than the other nanoceramic coatings tested, although its performance in a dilute sodium chloride solution was below that of the zinc phosphate-based coating. Although the nanoceramic coatings exhibited poor electrochemical behavior compared to the zinc-based coatings, they had a higher corrosion resistance when associated with an organic coating.","[Kerstner, Estela Knopp; Kunst, Sandra Raquel; Rossa Beltrami, Lilian Vanessa; Ortega Vega, Maria Rita; Malfatti, Celia de Fraga] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Lab Pesquisa Corrosao LAPEC, Programa Posgrad Engn Minas Met & Mat PPGEM, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Scienza, Lisete Cirstina] UCS, Lab Corrosao Pesquisa LACORP, Programa Posgrad Engn Proc & Tecnol PGEPROTEC, Caxias Do Sul, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Universidade de Caxias do Sul,"Kerstner, EK (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Lab Pesquisa Corrosao LAPEC, Programa Posgrad Engn Minas Met & Mat PPGEM, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",celia.malfatti@ufrgs.br,"Beltrami, Lilian/G-2335-2017; MALFATTI, CELIA/O-4102-2018; Scienza, Lisete/C-8756-2017","Ortega Vega, Maria Rita/0000-0002-6049-2831; Beltrami, Lilian Vanessa Rossa/0000-0001-5430-2598; MALFATTI, CELIA/0000-0002-0819-479X; Scienza, Lisete/0000-0002-4689-632X",CAPES; CNPQ,CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); CNPQ(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"The present work was carried out with support of CAPES and CNPQ, Brazilian Government entity focused in human resources formation.",,27.0,8,8,1,14,"UNIV FED SAO CARLOS, DEPT ENGENHARIA MATERIALS",SAO CARLOS,"LABORATORIA DE MATERIAIS VITREOS, CAIXA POSTAL 676, SAO CARLOS, 13565-905SP, BRAZIL",1516-1439,1980-5373,,MATER RES-IBERO-AM J,Mater.

Improving the endothelial cell attachment and blood-contacting properties of PDMS-based copolymers would substantially improve their clinical applications. We have studied the surface properties and in vitro biocompatibility of two series of segmented poly(urethane-dimethylsiloxane)s (SPU-PDMS) based on hydroxypropyl-and hydroxyethoxypropyl-terminated PDMS with potential applications in blood-contacting medical devices. SPU-PDMS copolymers were characterized by contact angle measurements, surface free energy determination (calculated using the van Oss-Chaudhury-Good and Owens-Wendt methods), and atomic force microscopy. The biocompatibility of copolymers was evaluated using an endothelial EA.hy926 cell line by direct contact assay, before and after pre-treatment of copolymers with multicomponent protein mixture, as well as by a competitive blood-protein adsorption assay. The obtained results suggested good blood compatibility of synthesized copolymers. All copolymers exhibited good resistance to fibrinogen adsorption and all favored albumin adsorption. Copolymers based on hydroxyethoxypropyl-PDMS had lower hydrophobicity, higher surface free energy and better microphase separation in comparison with hydroxypropyl-PDMS-based copolymers, which promoted better endothelial cell attachment and growth on the surface of these polymers as compared to hydroxypropyl-PDMS-based copolymers. The results showed that SPU-PDMS copolymers display good surface properties, depending on the type of soft PDMS segments, which can be tailored for biomedical application requirements such as biomedical devices for short-and long-term uses.","[Pergal, Marija V.; Vasiljevic-Radovic, Dana] Univ Belgrade, Inst Chem Technol & Met, Belgrade 11000, Serbia; [Nestorov, Jelena; Tovilovic-Kovacevic, Gordana] Univ Belgrade, Inst Biol Res Sinisa Stankovic, Dept Biochem, Belgrade 11000, Serbia; [Jovancic, Petar; Djonlagic, Jasna] Univ Belgrade, Fac Technol & Met, Belgrade 11000, Serbia; [Pezo, Lato] Univ Belgrade, Inst Gen & Phys Chem, Belgrade 11000, Serbia",University of Belgrade; University of Belgrade; University of Belgrade; University of Belgrade,"Pergal, MV (corresponding author), Univ Belgrade, Ctr Chem, Inst Chem Technol & Met, Njegoseva 12, Belgrade 11000, Serbia.",marijav@chem.bg.ac.rs,"Brkljacic, Jelena/JQW-4422-2023; Vasiljevic-Radovic, Dana/C-8034-2016; Pezo, Lato/D-6650-2014; Tovilovic-Kovacevic, Gordana/IUP-2084-2023","Brkljacic, Jelena/0000-0003-1978-8646; Vasiljevic-Radovic, Dana/0000-0002-7609-8599; Pezo, Lato/0000-0002-0704-3084; Pergal, Marija/0000-0001-6078-2006; Jovancic, Petar/0000-0002-9905-6260; Tovilovic-Kovacevic, Gordana/0000-0001-6150-3996","Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia [172062]","Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia","This work was financially supported by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia (Project No. 172062).",,31.0,4,4,2,44,ASSOC CHEMICAL ENGINEERS SERBIA,BELGRADE,"KNEZA MILOSA 9-I, BELGRADE, 11000, SERBIA",0367-598X,2217-7426,,HEM IND,Hem.

Its hardness and low density are attractive properties for such industrial areas. However, since it contains copper, it undergoes severe corrosion in aggressive media as saline or low Earth orbit environments. In this work, it was investigated the properties of films deposited by PECVD on AA 2024 aluminum alloy as well as the corrosion resistance of the film/substrate systems under different corrosive atmospheres. Films were prepared in a plasma atmosphere composed of 50% of oxygen and 50% of hexamethyldisiloxane resulting in a total gas pressure of 4.0 Pa. Plasma ignition was promoted by the application of radiofrequency signal (13.56 MHz) to the sample holder while grounding the topmost electrode. The plasma excitation power, P, was changed from 10 to 80 W in the six different set of experiments. Film thickness, measured by profilometer, increases by 5 times as P was elevated from 10 to 80 W. As demonstrated by the infrared spectra of the samples, films are essentially organosilicons with preservation of functional groups of the precursor molecule and with creation of different ones. The oxide proportion and the structure crosslinking degree are affected by the plasma excitation power. According to the results obtained by sessile drop technique, hydrophilic to moderately hydrophobic films are produced with changing P from 10 to 80 W. The corrosion resistance, evaluated by salt spray and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, EIS, experiments, in general increases after film deposition. It is demonstrated that film deposition improves, in up to 36 times, the resistance of the alloy to salt spray attack. It is also shown an improvement of about 240 times in the alloy resistance under NaCl solution by the EIS data. Micrographs acquired by Scanning Electron Microscopy after the corrosion tests furnish further information on the importance of the layer physical stability on its barrier properties. Furthermore, films highly protect the alloy against the oxygen attack. Interpretations are proposed based on the modification of the plasma kinetics with P, altering film structure, composition and properties.","[Tavares Mascagni, Daniela Branco; Pires de Souza, Maria Eliziane; Cipriano Rangel, Rita de Cassia; da Cruz, Nilson Cristino; Rangel, Elidiane Cipriano] Paulista State Univ UNESP, Lab Technol Plasmas, Sorocaba, SP, Brazil; [de Alvarenga Freire, Celia Marina] Univ Estadual Campinas, Dept Mat Engn, Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Silva, Selma Luiza] Ctr Tecnol Marinha Sao Paulo ARAMAR, Ipero, SP, Brazil",Universidade Estadual Paulista; Universidade Estadual de Campinas,"Mascagni, DBT (corresponding author), Paulista State Univ UNESP, Lab Technol Plasmas, Expt Campus Sorocaba, Sorocaba, SP, Brazil.",danibtmascagni@gmail.com,"Mascagni, Daniela/A-2890-2014; Rangel, Elidiane/D-3261-2012; Cruz, Nilson/AAG-8366-2020; Cipriano Rangel, Elidiane/AAT-2660-2020; Souza, Maria/B-9027-2015; C Cruz, Nilson/C-8519-2012","Cipriano Rangel, Elidiane/0000-0001-7909-190X; Souza, Maria/0000-0002-9184-3921; Cipriano Rangel, Rita de Cassia/0000-0002-9417-0638; C Cruz, Nilson/0000-0002-0354-3890",Capes; Fapesp,Capes(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Fapesp(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)),"The authors thank Capes and Fapesp for financial support, Prof. Dr. Antonio Junior Riul for technical support and Centro Tecnologico da Marinha em Sao Paulo - ARAMAR.",,30.0,12,12,1,28,"UNIV FED SAO CARLOS, DEPT ENGENHARIA MATERIALS",SAO CARLOS,"LABORATORIA DE MATERIAIS VITREOS, CAIXA POSTAL 676, SAO CARLOS, 13565-905SP, BRAZIL",1516-1439,1980-5373,,MATER RES-IBERO-AM J,Mater.

Different approaches have been used for preventing biofilm-related infections in health care settings. Many of these methods have their own demerits that include chemical-based complications; emergent antibiotic-resistant strains, and so on. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are renowned for their influential antimicrobial activity. We demonstrate the biofilm formation by extended spectrum beta-lactamases-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. by direct visualization applying tissue culture plate, tube, and Congo red agar methods. Double fluorescent staining for confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) consisted of propidium iodide staining to detect bacterial cells and concanavalin A-fluorescein isothiocyanate staining to detect the exopolysaccharides matrix were used. Scanning electron microscopy observations clearly indicate that AgNPs reduced the surface coverage by E. coli and Klebsiella spp. thus prevent the biofilm formations. Double-staining technique using CLSM provides the visual evidence that AgNPs arrested the bacterial growth and prevent the exopolysaccharides formation. The AgNPs-coated surfaces effectively restricted biofilm formation of the tested bacteria. In our study, we could demonstrate the complete antibiofilm activity AgNPs at a concentration as low as 50 mu g/ml. Our findings suggested that AgNPs can be exploited towards the development of potential antibacterial coatings for various biomedical and environmental applications. These formulations can be used for the treatment of drug-resistant bacterial infections caused by biofilms, at much lower nanosilver loading with higher efficiency.","[Ansari, Mohammad Azam; Khan, Haris M.] Aligarh Muslim Univ, Dept Microbiol, Jawaharlal Nehru Med Coll & Hosp, Nanotechnol & Drug Resistance Res Lab, Aligarh 202002, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Khan, Aijaz A.] Aligarh Muslim Univ, Dept Anat, Jawaharlal Nehru Med Coll & Hosp, Aligarh 202002, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Cameotra, Swaranjit Singh] Inst Microbial Technol IMTECH CSIR, Sect 39-A, Chandigarh 160036, India; [Pal, Ruchita] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Adv Instrumentat Res Facil, New Delhi, India","Aligarh Muslim University; Aligarh Muslim University; Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - Institute of Microbial Technology (IMTECH); Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi","Ansari, MA (corresponding author), Aligarh Muslim Univ, Dept Microbiol, Jawaharlal Nehru Med Coll & Hosp, Nanotechnol & Drug Resistance Res Lab, Aligarh 202002, Uttar Pradesh, India.",azammicro@gmail.com,"; ANSARI, MOHAMMAD AZAM/R-3143-2017","Khan, Haris M/0000-0002-5352-310X; ANSARI, MOHAMMAD AZAM/0000-0002-6122-5479","Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), New Delhi-India [35/15/BMS-11]","Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), New Delhi-India(Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR))","The authors would like to acknowledge SAIF-DST, Department of Anatomy, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, for HRTEM and Advanced Instrumentation Research facility, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India for SEM and CLSM observation.

Ethyl perfluorobutyl ether (EFE), a hydrofluoroether, can be used as a solvent for preparing silica particle suspensions for EPD. EFE is polar, nonflammable, and has a high density. In addition, the electrical insulation of EFE allows significant power savings over conventional EPD. In this study, the power consumption of EPD with EFE was compared with that of EPD with various common solvents. The silica particle suspension showed a high zeta potential in EFE. Power consumption per unit deposition amount in EFE at 10V was 6.4 x 10(-5)% of that of water at 100V. Similarly, it was 2.6 x 10(-3)% of that of acetone, 7.8 x 10(-5)% of that of ethanol, and 7.5 x 10(-5)% of that of ethanol at 100V.

Porous ZrO2 tapes were developed using starch and an acrylic latex as fugitive additive and binder, respectively. Two different binders, poly(vinyl)alcohol (PVA) and latex were used to prepare the fluorapatite dip coating slips. The influence of the suspension properties and the porous structure of the tape surfaces (top and bottom) on the formation rate and consequently on the layer thickness formed on each surface were studied. In addition, the microstructure of the layers produced by using the different dip-coating slips were compared and the osteoblastic cellular response to the different FA coating layers was examined. A greater initial thickness of the layer adhered was found for the tapes dip coated in the FA slip with latex; for immersion times >0, the casting rate was observed to be strongly influenced by both the structure of the tape surfaces and the suspension properties. For both FA slurries, the casting rate at the top surface of the tapes was greater than that at the bottom surface. Sintered layers with thickness 8-9 times greater on both tape surfaces were found using the dip coating slip with latex. For each tape surface, the casting rate was accelerated and the layer shrink during sintering was reduced by using the dip coating slip with latex. The coating layer produced with latex enhanced the osteogenic potential of osteoblastic cells in vitro, which is ultimately an indication of the material's capacity to promote bone repair in vivo.

Direct imaging and profiling of N-glycans on tissue sections can reveal tissue-specific and/or disease-associated N-glycans, which not only could serve as molecular signatures for diagnosis but also shed light on the functional roles of these biomolecules. Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful tool that has been used to correlate peptides, proteins, lipids, and metabolites with their underlying histopathology in tissue sections. Here, we report an MSI technique for direct analysis of N-glycans from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. This technique consists of sectioning FFPE tissues, deparaffinization, and rehydration of the sections, denaturing tissue proteins, releasing N-linked glycans from proteins by printing peptide-N-glycosidase F over the sections, spray-coating the tissue with matrix, and analyzing N-glycans by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). Brain sections from a C57BL/6 mouse were imaged using this technique at a resolution of 100 mu pm. Forty-two N-glycans were analyzed from the mouse brain section. The mass spectrometry images were used to study the relative abundance of oligomannose, nonfucosylated, and fucosylated complex N-glycans in different brain areas including isocortex, hippocampal formation, and brainstem and specific glycans associated with different areas of the brain were identified. Furthermore, glioblastoma tumor xenografts in a NOD/SCID mouse were imaged. Several glycans with differential expression in tumor versus normal brain tissues were identified. The MSI technique allows for imaging of N-glycans directly from FFPE sections. This method can potentially identify tissue-specific and/or disease-associated glycans coexpressed with other molecular signatures or within certain histological structures.","[Eshghi, Shadi Toghi; Li, Xingde] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biomed Engn, Baltimore, MD 21231 USA; [Yang, Shuang; Wang, Xiangchun; Shah, Punit; Zhang, Hui] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Baltimore, MD 21231 USA",Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins University,"Zhang, H (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Baltimore, MD 21231 USA.",hzhang32@jhu.edu,"Li, Xingde/F-7663-2012","Toghi Eshghi, Shadi/0000-0002-0254-7814","National Institutes of Health under National Cancer Institute, Clinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Consortium [U24CA160036]; Early Detection Research Network (EDRN) [U01CA152813, U24CA115102, R01CA112314]; National Heart Lung Blood Institute, Programs Excellence in Glycosciences [P01HL107153]; NHLBI Proteomic Center [N01-HV-00240]","National Institutes of Health under National Cancer Institute, Clinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Consortium; Early Detection Research Network (EDRN)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)); National Heart Lung Blood Institute, Programs Excellence in Glycosciences; NHLBI Proteomic Center","We thank Dr. S.

In-Situ Combustion (ISC) oil production technique is a new method that uses injection of air and ignition techniques to reduce the viscosity of bitumen in a reservoir and as a result crude bitumen can be produced and extracted from the reservoir. During the in-situ combustion process, production pipes and other mechanical components can be exposed to air-like gaseous environments at extreme temperatures as high as 700 degrees C. To protect or reduce the surface degradation of pipes and mechanical components used in in-situ combustion, the use of nickel-based ceramic-metallic (cermet) coating produced by co-electrodeposition of nanosized Al2O3 and TiO2 have been suggested and earlier research on these coatings have shown promising oxidation resistance against atmospheric oxygen and combustion gases at elevated temperatures. Co-electrodeposition of nickel-based cermet coatings is a low-cost method that has the benefit of allowing both internal and external surfaces of pipes and components to be coated during a single electroplating process. Research has shown that the volume fraction of dispersed nanosized Al2O3 and TiO2 particles in the nickel matrix which affects the oxidation resistance of the coating can be controlled by the concentration of these particles in the electrolyte solution, as well as the applied current density during electrodeposition. This paper investigates the high temperature oxidation behaviour of novel nanostructured cermet coatings composed of two types of dispersed nanosized ceramic particles (Al2O3 and TiO2) in a nickel matrix and produced by co-electrodeposition technique as a function of the concentration of these particles in the electrolyte solution and applied current density. For this purpose, high temperature oxidation tests were conducted in dry air for 96 hours at 700 degrees C to obtain mass changes (per unit of area) at specific time intervals. Statistical techniques as described in ASTM G16 were used to formulate the oxidation mass change as a function of time. The cross-section and surface of the oxidized coatings were examined for both visual and chemical analyses using wavelength dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (WDS) element mapping, X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The results showed that the volume fraction for each type of particle in the nickel matrix corresponded to its partial molar concentration in the electrolyte solutions. Increase in volume fraction of particles in the nickel matrix was correlated to lower oxidation rates. It was concluded that formation of Ni3TiO5 and NiTiO3 compounds can reduce the oxidation rate of cermet coatings by capturing some inward diffusing oxygen ions resulting in a lower number of nickel cations diffusing upward into the oxide layer.","[Farrokhzad, M.

The aim of the research was the analysis of structural, optical and electrical properties of the deposited thin films.

The as-deposited coatings were amorphous, while annealing at 873 K caused a structural change to the mixture of TiO2 anatase-rutile phases. The prepared thin films exhibited good transparency with transmission level of ca. 50 % and low resistivity varying from 2 Omega cm to 5.10(-2) Omega cm, depending on the time and temperature of annealing. What is worth to emphasize, the sign of Seebeck coefficient changed after the annealing process from the electron to hole type electrical conduction.","[Mazur, Michal; Kaczmarek, Danuta; Prociow, Eugeniusz; Domaradzki, Jaroslaw; Wojcieszak, Damian; Bochenski, Jakub] Wroclaw Univ Technol, Fac Microsyst Elect & Photon, PL-50372 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Science & Technology,"Mazur, M (corresponding author), Wroclaw Univ Technol, Fac Microsyst Elect & Photon, Janiszewskiego 11-17, PL-50372 Wroclaw, Poland.",michal.mazur@pwr.wroc.pl,"Mazur, Michal/B-9215-2014","Mazur, Michal/0000-0002-6997-4204; Kaczmarek, Danuta/0000-0002-0013-1225; Wojcieszak, Damian/0000-0001-6831-4477; Domaradzki, Jaroslaw/0000-0002-4707-6817","NCN [DEC-2012/05/N/ST7/00173, DEC-2013/08/T/ST7/00131, DEC-2013/09/B/ST7/01592]",NCN,"This work was financed from the sources granted by the NCN in the years 2013 - 2015 and 2014 - 2017 as a research projects No.: DEC-2012/05/N/ST7/00173, DEC-2013/08/T/ST7/00131 and DEC-2013/09/B/ST7/01592.",,18.0,9,9,0,16,SCIENDO,WARSAW,"DE GRUYTER POLAND SP Z O O, BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR, 01-811 WARSAW, POLAND",2083-134X,,,MATER SCI-POLAND,Mater.

Such investigations require profound knowledge of the behavior of ZnO in cell culture media. The current study was performed to get well-dispersed suspensions of a hydrophilic (ZnO-hydro) and a lipophilic coated (ZnO-lipo) ZnO nanomaterial for use in in vitro tests. Therefore, systematic tests were carried out with common dispersants (phosphate, lecithin, proteins) to elucidate chemical and physical changes of ZnO nanoparticles in water and physiological solutions (PBS, DMEM). Nonphysiological stock suspensions were prepared using ultrasonication. Time-dependent changes of pH, conductivity, zeta potential, particle size and dissolution were recorded. Secondly, the stock suspensions were added to physiological media with or without albumin (BSA) or serum (FBS), to examine characteristics such as agglomeration and dissolution. Stable stock suspensions were obtained using phosphate as natural and physiological electrostatic stabilizing agent. Lecithin proved to be an effective wetting agent for ZnO-lipo. Although the particle size remained constant, the suspension changed over time. The pH increased as a result of ZnO dissolution and formation of zinc phosphate complexes. The behavior of ZnO in physiological media was found to depend strongly on the additives used. Applying only phosphate as additive, ZnOhydro agglomerated within minutes. In the presence of lecithin or BSA/serum, agglomeration was inhibited. ZnO dissolution was higher under physiological conditions than in the stock suspension. Serum especially promoted this process. Using body-related dispersants (phosphate, lecithin) non-agglomerating stock suspensions of hydrophilic and lipophilic ZnO were prepared as a prerequisite to perform meaningful toxicological investigation. Both nanomaterials showed a non-negligible dissolution behavior that strongly depended on the surrounding conditions. Agglomeration of ZnO particles in physiological media is a complex function of particle coating, used dispersants and serum proteins if supplemented. The present study gives a clear guideline how to prepare and handle suspensions with ZnO for in vitro testing and allows the correlation between the chemical-physical particles behavior with findings from toxicological tests.","[Meissner, Tobias; Oelschlagel, Kathrin; Potthoff, Annegret] Fraunhofer Inst Ceram Technol & Syst, Winterbergstr 28, D-01277 Dresden, Germany",Fraunhofer Gesellschaft; Fraunhofer Germany; Fraunhofer Ceramic Technologies & Systems,"Meissner, T (corresponding author), Fraunhofer Inst Ceram Technol & Syst, Winterbergstr 28, D-01277 Dresden, Germany.",tmeiss@gmx.net; kathrin.oelschlaegel@ikts.fraunhofer.de; annegret.potthoff@ikts.fraunhofer.de,,"Oelschlagel, Kathrin/0000-0002-6472-3190",,,,,47.0,34,35,0,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2008-9295,2228-5326,,INT NANO LETT,Int.

However, high reactivity of BICUVOX.10 towards the electrolytes still has been its greatest shortcoming. This paper describes reactions between BICUVOX.10 and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolytes. Secondary phases formed were evaluated by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and a. c. impedance spectroscopy. A deleterious interaction between BICUVOX.10 and YSZ was observed, mainly regarding the yttrium depletion from ZrO2 lattice through reaction with VO2.5, resulting in YVO4 phase nucleation and destabilization of the tetragonal and cubic ZrO2 polymorphs to monoclinic. The ZrO2 destabilization and YVO4 nucleation are related phenomena and were interpreted through a theoretical mechanism using charge-compensating dopants description. Thus, these reactions were seen as detrimental to the cathode/electrolyte contact, especially regarding the highly resistive layer formed in the BICUVOX.10/YSZ junction, discouraging further usage of BICUVOX.10 as a cathode in yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolytes.","[Piva, Roger Honorato; Morelli, Marcio Raymundo] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Mat Engn DEMa, Lab Ceram Formulat & Synth, Postgrad Program Mat Sci & Engn PPG CEM, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil; [Piva, Diogenes Honorato] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Lab Ceram Mat, BR-90035190 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Souza, Marcelo Tramontin] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Lab Glass Ceram Mat, BR-88040900 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC),"Piva, RH (corresponding author), Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Mat Engn DEMa, Lab Ceram Formulat & Synth, Postgrad Program Mat Sci & Engn PPG CEM, Rod Washington Luis,Km 235, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.",rogerh.piva@ufscar.br,"Piva, Diógenes/ABB-2408-2020; Morelli, Márcio/M-3601-2014; Tramontin Souza, Marcelo/P-3814-2018; Honorato Piva, Roger/F-2238-2013; Honorato Piva, Diogenes/J-4958-2017","Tramontin Souza, Marcelo/0000-0002-7831-4451; Honorato Piva, Roger/0000-0002-8960-7321; Honorato Piva, Diogenes/0000-0002-0755-2890",CNPq [131239/2012-0]; CAPES,CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),The authors acknowledge the CNPq (project 131239/2012-0) and CAPES for the financial support provided for this research.,,23.0,5,5,0,15,"UNIV FED SAO CARLOS, DEPT ENGENHARIA MATERIALS",SAO CARLOS,"LABORATORIA DE MATERIAIS VITREOS, CAIXA POSTAL 676, SAO CARLOS, 13565-905SP, BRAZIL",1516-1439,1980-5373,,MATER RES-IBERO-AM J,Mater.

HA powder is synthesized and used for preparation of HA/ethanol suspension which is subsequently characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), zeta potential and particle size analyses. Samples are prepared from commercially pure titanium (CP-Ti) substrates and coated with HA using EPD at dynamic voltage that keeps a constant depositional rate by adjusting the current and electrical field during the process. The HA-coated samples are dried and sintered at 800 degrees C for 2 h to densify the coatings. The XRD, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), EDS and adhesion tests are used to characterize the coated samples. The cross-sectional SEM images indicate that the thickness of coatings enhances as the current increases from 0.07 to 0.35 mA. The coatings are more uniform, packed and non-cracked at lower currents while HA particles start to arrange in a highly porous structure and show non-uniform, cracked and non-stable coatings as the current increases. The results also demonstrate that the best adhesions for the coatings are obtained at lower currents of 0.07 and 0.15 mA. Morphological studies and cell biological experiments are conducted using MG63 cells cultured on the HA-coated sample with the best overall physical performance. The number of attached and proliferated cells on the selected HA-coated sample is higher than on the non-coated titanium sample and culture plate used as control. There are significantly higher ALP activity and better cytoskeleton organization of cells on the HA-coated sample. This study shows that the EPD process at dynamic voltage can influence the structure and morphology of the coatings; therefore, substrate engineering can be used to improve and control cell substrate interactions.

Hydroxyapatite (HA), micro-HA particles (HAp), a bioglass (BG) and their different mixtures together with polymer additives were used to control HA coating microstructures. Layered composites with the following coating-to-substrate designs, such as BG/Ti, HA + BG/BG/Ti and HAp + BG/BG/Ti, were fabricated. The bioactivity of these coated composites and the uncoated Ti-mesh substrate was then investigated in a simulated body fluid (SBF). The Ti-mesh substrate and BG/Ti composite did not induce biomimetic apatite deposition when they were immersed in SBF for the selected BG, a pressable dental ceramic, used in this study. After seven days in SBF, an apatite layer was formed on both HA + BG/BG/Ti and HAp + BG/BG/Ti composites. The difference is the apatite layer on the HAp + BG/BG/Ti composite was rougher and contained more micro-pores, while the apatite layer on the HA + BG/BG/Ti composite was dense and smooth.

Established measurement methods such as Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and the centrifugal method are costly and time consuming. For engineering applications there is a need to develop a quick test method. The drop test method has been designed and developed for this purpose. In this test method particles that are adhered to a substrate are mounted on and are subjected to a tensile force by impacting the stub against a stopper ring by dropping it from a set height. From the balance of the detachment force and adhesive force for a critical particles size, above which particles are detached and below which they remain on the substrate, the interfacial specific energy is calculated. A model of adhesion is required to estimate the adhesive force between the particles and the surface, and in this work we use the JKR theory. The detachment force is estimated by Newton's second law of motion, using an estimated particle mass, based on its size and density and calculated particle acceleration. A number of materials such as silanised glass beads, Avicel, alpha-lactose monohydrate and starch have been tested and the adhesive force and energy between the particle and the substrate surface have been quantified. Consistent values of the interface energy with a narrow error band are obtained, independent of the impact velocity. As the latter is varied, different particle sizes detach; nevertheless similar values of the interface energy are obtained, an indication that the technique is robust, as it is in fact based on microscopic observations of many particles. The trends of the results obtained with the drop test method are similar to those shown in studies by other researchers using established methods like the AFM and the centrifuge method.

The ISP parameters, such as carrier gas flow rate, solution flow rate and substrate temperature, were controlled with an accuracy of +/- 0.25 lpm, +/- 1 ml/h and +/- 1 degrees C, respectively. The solution was sprayed in a pulsed mode. The substrate temperature was optimized by analyzing substrate temperature dependent properties of thin films. The thin film deposited at a temperature of 450 degrees C was dense and fairly smooth with satisfactory crystallinity and very small impurity content. The effect of precursor ratio in the solution on structural, compositional and optical properties of thin ZnS films, deposited at a temperature of 450 degrees C, was studied. A gradual increase in band gap energy from 3.524 eV to 3.634 eV, refractive index from 2.5 to 2.9 and dielectric constant from 6.6 to 8.7 were observed with the variation of solution precursor (Zn:S) ratio from (1:2) to (1:6). The structural and compositional studies support this kind of enhancement in optical properties. The results show that the thin ZnS film prepared by ISP at the substrate temperature of 450 degrees C from a solution with specific precursor ratio can be used for optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications.","[Zaware, Rangnath V.] SN Arts DJM Commerce & BNS Sci Coll, Dept Phys, Ahmednagar 422605, Maharashtra, India; [Wagh, Bhiva G.] KKW Arts Sci & Commerce Coll, Nasik, Maharashtra, India",,"Zaware, RV (corresponding author), SN Arts DJM Commerce & BNS Sci Coll, Dept Phys, Ahmednagar 422605, Maharashtra, India.",r.v.zaware@gmail.com,,,"Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), India; ISRO Uop-STC, Pune (India); DRDO, India","Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), India; ISRO Uop-STC, Pune (India); DRDO, India(Defence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO))","The work was supported by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), India.

According to the Si-Mo diffusion couple and Arrhenius equation, the activation energy (Q) was obtained as 430 kJ.mol(-1), and the Arrhenius dependence of D on temperature can be described as D = 4.9 x 10(-3) exp(-430000/RT) m(2)/s.

The proteins were covalently attached to the surfaces of the probes by incubation in the protein deposits (footprints) left behind at the surface by the cyprids. This covalent coupling enabled robust and reproducible probing of adhesion of the attachment proteins to model surfaces with variable hydrophilicity. Three model monolayer surfaces were designed and prepared that exhibited different wettabilities derived from variations in the monolayer chemical composition. The morphology and size of cyprid protein deposits was imaged by AFM. The deposits showed larger area of spreading on more hydrophobic surfaces, whereas the overall volume of the secreted proteins exhibited no significant variation. Notable difference in adhesion forces was found among the surfaces by force spectroscopy, with substantially higher values measured on the hydrophobic surface (21 +/- 2 nN) than that measured on the more hydrophilic surface (7.2 +/- 1 nN). The same surfaces were also tested in laboratory essays. Rather surprisingly, no significant differences were found in values of fractional cyprid settlement among the surfaces studied, indicating that variations of surface wettability and adhesion strength of settlement proteins may be insufficient to explain settlement trends.","[Guo, Shifeng; Puniredd, Sreenivasa Reddy; Janczewski, Dominik; He, Tao; Zhu, Xiaoying] ASTAR, Inst Mat Res & Engn, Singapore 117602, Singapore; [Lee, Serina Siew Chen; Teo, Serena Lay Ming] Natl Univ Singapore, Trop Marine Sci Inst, Singapore 119227, Singapore; [Vancso, G.

METHODS: Data for patients diagnosed with drug-induced esophagitis from April 2002 to May 2013 was reviewed. Patients diagnosed with malignancy, viral or fungal esophagitis were excluded. Clinical, endoscopic and pathological characteristics of patients diagnosed with drug-induced esophagitis were analyzed. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients were diagnosed with drug-induced esophagitis. Their mean age was 43.9 +/- 18.9 years and 35.9% were male. Common symptoms were chest pain (71.8%), odynophagia (38.5%) and dysphagia (29.5%). The endoscopic location was in the middle third of esophagus in 78.2%. Endoscopic findings were ulcer (82.1%), erosion (17.9%), ulcer with bleeding (24.4%), coating with drug material (5.1%), impacted pill fragments (3.8%) and stricture (2.6%). Kissing ulcers were observed in 43.6%. The main causative agents were antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. All the patients were treated with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or sucralfate, and the causative drugs were discontinued. Nineteen patients with drug-induced esophagitis were followed up with endoscopy and revealed normal findings, scars or healing ulcers. CONCLUSION: Drug-induced esophagitis mainly presents as chest pain, odynophagia and dysphagia, and may be successfully treated with PPIs and discontinuation of the causative drug. Kissing ulcers were observed in 43.6%. (C) 2014 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

In electronics, the diode is an electrical component with asymmetric current transfer characteristics. A light (<2 g/m(2)) superhydrophobic conformal coating applied onto one side of a porous substrate is shown to create a liquid transport function analogous to the electronic diode, facilitating fluid movement in one direction under negligible penetration pressures, but opposing it in reverse up to greater pressures. The phenomenon is driven by capillary action and can be observed using any similarly-thin fluid barrier applied on only one side (i.e., wettability contrast) of an absorbent porous matrix. Diodic action and liquid transport rates are shown to be highly tunable, determined by fiber diameter and spacing, in combination with coating deposition amount. As an example, the device is used to separate an oil/water mixture, relying upon the surface tension differences of the mixture constituents, and may be implemented in multicomponent fluid filtration/separation technologies.","[Mates, Joseph E.; Schutzius, Thomas M.; Megaridis, Constantine M.] Univ Illinois, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Schutzius, Thomas M.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Mech & Proc Engn, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Qin, Jian] Kimberly Clark Inc, Corp Res & Engn, Neenah, WI 54956 USA; [Waldroup, Don E.] Kimberly Clark Inc, Corp Res & Engn, Roswell, GA 30076 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Kimberly-Clark; Kimberly-Clark,"Megaridis, CM (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",cmm@uic.edu,"Schutzius, Thomas/HLH-7988-2023; Megaridis, Constantine/A-1632-2009","Megaridis, Constantine/0000-0002-6339-6933; Schutzius, Thomas/0000-0003-3309-3568",Kimberly-Clark Corp.,Kimberly-Clark Corp.,This material is based upon work supported by Kimberly-Clark Corp. which also contributed the test substrates.,,27.0,70,76,6,118,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1944-8244,1944-8252,,ACS APPL MATER INTER,ACS Appl.

Moreover, the use of acetic acid as a catalyst in the sol enables a more complete hydrolysis of the silane precursors due to the fact that the acetic acid goes through a more complete ionization when in aqueous solution. The aim of this paper is to study the effect of the concentration of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) on the protective properties of the film on tinplate substrate. The tinplate was coated with a hybrid film obtained from a sol-gel method constituted of the following alkoxide precursors: 3 - (trimetoxisililpropil) methacrylate (TMSM) and poly(methyl methacrylate) PMMA. The effect of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) concentration has also been evaluated. The films hydrolysis was performed at a pH value of 3.0 using acetic acid as a catalyst. The films were obtained by dip-coating process, cured for 3 hours at 160 degrees C. The film morphology was evaluated by SEM and profilometry. The electrochemical behavior of the films was evaluated by open circuit potential monitoring, potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The film hydrophobicity was determined by contact angle measurements. The studied films have shown good performance as to corrosion resistance on tinplate. The hybrid film which was obtained through the addition of an excessive amount of TEOS (T3A3) showed increased thickness. Nevertheless, due to an intense densification of the film, promoted by the addition of TEOS, a formation of cracks was registered, thereby compromising the corrosion resistance.","[Kunst, Sandra Raquel; Ludwig, Gustavo Aalberto; Piaggio Cardoso, Henrique Ribeiro; de Fraga Malfatti, Celia] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Dept Met PPGEM, Lab Pesquisa Corrosao LAPEC, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Santana, Joseane Andrade; Vitorino Sarmento, Victor Hugo] UFS, IQ, Itabaiana, SE, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,"Kunst, SR (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Dept Met PPGEM, Lab Pesquisa Corrosao LAPEC, Av Bento Goncalves 9500,Predio 75, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",tessaro.sandra@gmail.com,"Sarmento, Victor/AAL-1496-2020; MALFATTI, CELIA/O-4102-2018; Cardoso, Henrique/Q-9467-2016","MALFATTI, CELIA/0000-0002-0819-479X; Sarmento, Victor Hugo/0000-0001-6882-002X; Cardoso, Henrique/0000-0001-6383-1213",CAPES; CNPq; FAPERGS,CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); FAPERGS(Fundacao de Amparo a Ciencia e Tecnologia do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul (FAPERGS)),"The present work was carried out with support of CAPES, a Brazilian Governmental entity focused in human resources formation.

The microstructure was controlled by using different target ingots during the electron beam physical vapor deposition process. The double layer coating consists of Gd2Zr2O7 for the top layer and YSZ for the bottom layer. The microstructure, hardness, and thermal shock properties of the double layer deposited using a single-ingot process were compared with the results obtained with the two-ingot process. The single-ingot process involves forming the Gd2Zr2O7/YSZ double layer using a single YSZ/Gd2Zr2O7 double-layered ingot. The two-ingot process involves coating with each of the YSZ and Gd2Zr2O7 ingots. While the XRD results indicated that the same pyrochlore-fluorite structures are formed in those ingots, differences in the microstructure and composition were observed by FE-SEM and EDS analyses. These differences influence the hardness and thermal shock resistance of the coating. The results indicate that the finer singular columns produced by the two-ingot process do not improve the hardness, but delay the delamination of the top layer during thermal shock tests due to residual compressive stress and strain tolerance.

In the first step, we prepared a polyol solution containing H2PtCl6 and ethylene glycol at 110 degrees C, in which the reduction kinetics were controlled by adding various proportions of NaOH. In the second step, we immersed a thiol-modified TCO substrate into the polyol solution with monodispersed Pt nanoparticles prepared at pH 3.7 at approximately 295 K to complete the nanofabrication. The DSSC devices using Z907 dye as a photosensitizer and the CE prepared using this SAM-Pt approach attained notable photovoltaic performance (eta = 9.2%) comparable with those fabricated using a conventional thermal decomposition method (eta = 9.1%) or a cyclic electrodeposition method (eta = 9.3%) under the same experimental conditions.

It was evaluated the effect of the F127/Y molar relationship (0, 0.1, 0.2, 1.0, 1.2 and 5.0) on the structure and photoluminiscent properties of the derived thin films. After 3 dipping-cycles, XRD results showed that the F127-modified films began to crystallize at 600 degrees C into the cubic structure, and from 800 degrees C, was found that the presence of F127 changes the preferential orientation from a c 100 orientation, for the non-modified sample, to a < 111 > orientation, for the modified ones. M-lines spectroscopy characterization showed that the maximum thickness of the films modified and annealed at 900 degrees C was 1937nm (rho= 4.87 g cm(-3), eta = 1.887), compared with the 881nm (rho= 4.94 g cm(-3), eta = 1.907) for a non-modified sample. Differential thermal analysis (DTA) and infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were carried out to evaluate the chemical and structural evolution of the xerogel formed during the annealing process. AFM micrographs showed smooth crack-free surface (Ra = 9.2 nm) on a F127/Y = 0.2 sample. Finally, the films presented a typical Eu3+ reddish emission at 611 nm (D-o -> F-7(2)), which was analyzed as function of the F127 pluronic content and the annealing temperature.

A novel small-molecule-hosting film was constructed using layer-by-layer deposition of montmorillonite (MMT) clay nanoplatelets and polyacrylic acid (PAA) components, both of which carry a negative charge at neutral pH. The films were highly swollen in water, and they exhibited major changes in swelling as a function of pH. Under physiologic conditions (pH 7.5, 0.2 M NaCl), hydrogel-like MMT/PAA films took up and sequestered similar to 45% of the dry film matrix mass of the antibiotic gentamicin, causing dramatic film deswelling. Gentamicin remained sequestrated within the films for months under physiologic conditions and therefore did not contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance. When challenged with bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis or Escherichia coli), the coatings released PAA-bound gentamicin because of bacteria-induced acidification of the immediate environment, whereas gentamicin adsorbed to MMT nanoplatelets remained bound within the coating, affording sustained antibacterial protection. Moreover, an increase in film swelling after gentamicin release further hindered bacterial adhesion. These multiple bacteria-triggered responses, together with nontoxicity to tissue cells, make these coatings promising candidates for protecting biomaterial implants and devices against bacterial colonization.","[Pavlukhina, Svetlana; Zhuk, Iryna; Chang, Wei; Yu, Xiaojun; Sukhishvili, Svetlana A.] Stevens Inst Technol, Dept Chem Chem Biol & Biomed Engn, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA; [Mentbayeva, Almagul] Nazarbayev Univ, Sch Engn, Astana, Kazakhstan; [Rautenberg, Emily] Stevens Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA; [Rautenberg, Emily] Stevens Inst Technol, Dept Visual Arts & Technol, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA; [van de Belt-Gritter, Betsy; Busscher, Henk J.; van der Mei, Henny C.] Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; [van de Belt-Gritter, Betsy; Busscher, Henk J.; van der Mei, Henny C.] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Biomed Engn, NL-9713 AV Groningen, Netherlands",Stevens Institute of Technology; Nazarbayev University; Stevens Institute of Technology; Stevens Institute of Technology; University of Groningen; University of Groningen,"Sukhishvili, SA (corresponding author), Stevens Inst Technol, Dept Chem Chem Biol & Biomed Engn, 507 River St, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA.",ssukhish@stevens.edu,"Chang, Wei/E-6581-2019; YU, Xiaojun/A-1331-2016; Busscher, Henk/AAU-2113-2020; Mentbayeva, Almagul/N-3870-2017","Van der Mei, Henny C./0000-0003-0760-8900; Sukhishvili, Svetlana/0000-0002-2328-4494",,,,,40.0,52,57,0,80,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,NEW YORK,"75 VARICK ST, 9TH FLR, NEW YORK, NY 10013-1917 USA",1884-4049,1884-4057,,NPG ASIA MATER,NPG Asia Mater.,AUG,2014,6.0,,,,,,,,e121,10.1038/am.2014.63,0.0,,,10.0,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Materials Science,AO8SE,,"gold, Green Published",,,2025-04-23,WOS:000341623700005,0,

The direct fabrication of PRGO films onto Cu foils with partial oxygenated groups, an intensive stacked highly crystalline structure, and reduced graphene oxide regions enable significant performance enhancements when used as supercapacitor electrodes compared with other graphene-only devices, exhibiting high specific capacitances of 275 F g(-1) at a scan rate of 10mVs(-1) and 167 F g(-1) at 1 V g(-1) with excellent rate capability.

Probiotics promote mucin production by goblet cells in the intestine. p40, a Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG-derived soluble protein, has been shown to transactivate the EGF receptor (EGFR) in intestinal epithelial cells, which is required for inhibition of apoptosis and preservation of barrier function in the colon, thereby ameliorating intestinal injury and colitis. Because activation of EGFR has been shown to up-regulate mucin production in goblet cells, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects and mechanisms of p40 regulation of mucin production. p40 activated EGFR and its downstream target, Akt, in a concentration-dependent manner in LS174T cells. p40 stimulated Muc2 gene expression and mucin production in LS174T cells, which were abolished by inhibition of EGFR kinase activity, down-regulation of EGFR expression by EGFR siRNA transfection, or suppression of Akt activation. Treatment with p40 increased mucin production in the colonic epithelium, thus thickening the mucus layer in the colon of wild type, but not of Egfr(wa5) mice, which have a dominant negative mutation in the EGFR kinase domain. Furthermore, inhibition of mucin-type O-linked glycosylation suppressed the effect of p40 on increasing mucin production and protecting intestinal epithelial cells from TNF-induced apoptosis in colon organ culture. Thus, these results suggest that p40-stimulated activation of EGFR mediates up-regulation of mucin production, which may contribute to the mechanisms by which p40 protects the intestinal epithelium from injury.","[Wang, Lihong; Liu, Liping; Acra, Sari A.; Yan, Fang] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Pediat, Div Gastroenterol Hepatol & Nutr, Med Ctr, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Cao, Hailong; Wang, Bangmao] Tianjin Med Univ, Dept Gastroenterol, Gen Hosp, Tianjin 300052, Peoples R China; [Walker, W.

The oxide layer formed was characterized. Treatment at 940 degrees C for 60 min was found to be optimal for obtaining a Cr-rich rough oxide layer, with good adherence and homogeneity. Catalytic monoliths were prepared by dip-coating into four different slurries containing the Ni-Nb mixed oxide catalyst. The samples were characterized and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane to ethylene.

Higher AD and Ca2+ ion release was observed at lower pH (5.0) than that at higher pH (7.4). AD and Ca2+ release, surface morphology, and phase analysis after release indicated a matrix degradation dominated AD release caused by TCP dissolution. PCL coating showed its effectiveness for controlled and sustained AD release. Six different scaffold compositions, namely, (i) TCP (bare TCP), (ii) TCP + AD (AD-coated TCP), (iii) TCP + PCL (PCL-coated TCP), (iv) TCP + PCL + AD, (v) TCP + AD + PCL, and (vi) TCP + AD + PCL + AD were tested in the distal femoral defect of Sprague Dawley rats for 6 and 10 weeks. An excellent bone formation inside the micro and macro pores of the scaffolds was observed from histomorphology. Histomorphometric analysis revealed maximum new bone formation in TCP + AD + PCL scaffolds after 6 weeks. No adverse effect of PCL on bioactivity of TCP and in vivo bone formation was observed. All scaffolds with AD showed higher bone formation and reduced TRAP (tartrate resistant acid phosphatase) positive cells activity compared to bare TCP and TCP coated with only PCL. Bare TCP scaffolds showed the highest TRAP positive cells activity followed by TCP + PCL scaffolds, whereas TCP + AD scaffolds showed the lowest TRAP activity. A higher TRAP positive cells activity was observed in TCP + AD + PCL compared to TCP + AD scaffolds after 6 weeks. Our results show that in vivo local AD delivery from PCL-coated 3DP TCP scaffolds could further induce increased early bone formation.","[Tarafder, Solaiman; Bose, Susmita] Washington State Univ, Sch Mech & Mat Engn, WM Keck Biomed Mat Res Lab, Pullman, WA 99164 USA",Washington State University,"Bose, S (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Sch Mech & Mat Engn, WM Keck Biomed Mat Res Lab, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",sbose@wsu.edu,"Tarafder, Solaiman/F-4335-2011","Tarafder, Solaiman/0000-0001-9659-690X","National Institutes of Health, NIBIB [NIH-R01-EB-007351]","National Institutes of Health, NIBIB(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Biomedical Imaging & Bioengineering (NIBIB))","National Institutes of Health, NIBIB (Grant # NIH-R01-EB-007351).",,52.0,174,192,4,189,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1944-8244,1944-8252,,ACS APPL MATER INTER,ACS Appl.

These high surface area materials are invariably produced in particulate forms and need to be transformed into hierarchically porous structures for high performance adsorbents or catalysts. Structuring of porous powders enables an optimized structure with high mass transfer, low pressure drop, good heat management, and high mechanical and chemical stability. The requirements and important properties of hierarchically porous structures are reviewed with a focus on applications in gas separation and catalysis. Versatile powder processing routes to process porous powders into hierarchically porous structures like extrusion, coatings of scaffolds and honeycombs, colloidal processing and direct casting, and sacrificial approaches are presented and discussed. The use and limitations of the use of inorganic binders for increasing the mechanical strength is reviewed, and the most important binder systems, e.g. clays and silica, are described in detail. Recent advances to produce binder-free and complex shaped hierarchically porous monoliths are described and their performance is compared with traditional binder-containing structured adsorbents. Needs related to better thermal management and improved kinetics and volume efficiency are discussed and an outlook on future research is also given. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

For the monolayered systems, the 90 degrees C-cured system showed a lower layer thickness; however, this system showed a more compact, uniform and less porous layer, and presented better electrochemical impedance results, in comparison with the 60 degrees C-cured samples.","[Kunst, Sandra Raquel; Rossa Beltrami, Lilian Vanessa; Piaggio Cardoso, Henrique Ribeiro; Ortega Veja, Maria Rita; Kerstner Baldin, Estela Knopp; Malfatti, Celia de Fraga] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Lab Pesquisa Corrosao LAPEC, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Menezes, Tiago Lemos] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Lab Corrosao Protecao & Reciclagem Mat LACOR, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,"Kunst, SR (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Lab Pesquisa Corrosao LAPEC, Ave Bento Goncalves 9500, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",lvrossa@yahoo.com.br,"Beltrami, Lilian/G-2335-2017; Kerstner Baldin, Estela/O-6450-2018; MALFATTI, CELIA/O-4102-2018; Cardoso, Henrique/Q-9467-2016","Kerstner Baldin, Estela/0000-0001-8116-256X; Ortega Vega, Maria Rita/0000-0002-6049-2831; MALFATTI, CELIA/0000-0002-0819-479X; Beltrami, Lilian Vanessa Rossa/0000-0001-5430-2598; Cardoso, Henrique/0000-0001-6383-1213",CAPES (a Brazilian Governmental agency for the development of human resources); CNPq (the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development),CAPES (a Brazilian Governmental agency for the development of human resources)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); CNPq (the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),The authors would like to express their gratitude for the financial support of CAPES (a Brazilian Governmental agency for the development of human resources) and CNPq (the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development).,,41.0,12,13,0,4,"UNIV FED SAO CARLOS, DEPT ENGENHARIA MATERIALS",SAO CARLOS,"LABORATORIA DE MATERIAIS VITREOS, CAIXA POSTAL 676, SAO CARLOS, 13565-905SP, BRAZIL",1516-1439,1980-5373,,MATER RES-IBERO-AM J,Mater.

Randomly 1:1 mixed polymer brushes of poly-3-sulfopropyl methacrylate (PSPM) and poly-2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (PHEMA) showed a 6-fold increase of the TOF value compared to the solely PSPM-containing microreactor. This remarkable improvement is attributed to the cooperative stabilizing effect of proximal OH groups on the active sulfonic acid moieties within the brush architecture. In fact, the rational mixing of SPM with methyl methacrylate (MMA) as an OH-free comonomer caused a drop in the activity of the resulting catalytic platform. A 5-fold increase of the TON of the 1:1 PSPM PHEMA versus the PSPM homopolymer brush systems additionally demonstrates the substantial increase in the stability of the mixed brushes catalytic platform, which could be continuously run over 7 days without significant loss of activity. The 1:1 PSPM PHEMA mixed brush catalytic system also showed a good activity in the deprotection of 2-benzyl tetrahydropyranyl ether.","[Ricciardi, Roberto; Munirathinam, Rajesh; Huskens, Jurriaan; Verboom, Willem] Univ Twente, MESA Inst Nanotechnol, Lab Mol Nanofabricat, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands",University of Twente,"Verboom, W (corresponding author), Univ Twente, MESA Inst Nanotechnol, Lab Mol Nanofabricat, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.",w.verboom@utwente.nl,"Munirathinam, Rajesh/AAE-6693-2019; Huskens, Jurriaan/IQV-5943-2023","Munirathinam, Rajesh/0000-0002-9164-9520",Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [ECHO.09.TD.024],Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),We gratefully acknowledge The Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) for financial support (project ECHO.09.TD.024).

The goal of this research was to develop multifunctional composite chitosan/Bioglass coatings loaded with gentamicin antibiotic as a suitable strategy to improve the surface properties of metallic implants. Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) was applied as a single-step technology to simultaneously deposit the biopolymer, bioactive glass particles, and the antibiotic on stainless steel substrate. The microstructure and composition of the coatings were characterized using SEM/EDX, XRD, FTIR, and TGA/DSC, respectively. The in vitro bioactivity of the coatings was demonstrated by formation of hydroxyapatite after immersion in simulated body fluid (SBF) in a short period of 2 days. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) measurements indicated the release of 40% of the loaded gentamicin in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) within the first 5 days. The developed composite coating supported attachment and proliferation of MG-63 cells up to 10 days.

Despite the current use of bioresorbable polyesters such as poly(L-lactide) (PLA), poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), and poly-epsilon-caprolactone in soft tissue regeneration researches, their hydrophobic properties negatively influence the cell adhesion. Here, to overcome it, we have developed a fibronectin (FN)-functionalized electrospun PLGA scaffold for periodontal ligament regeneration. Functionalization of electrospun PLGA scaffolds was performed by alkaline hydrolysis (0.1 or 0.01M NaOH). Then, hydrolyzed scaffolds were coated by simple deposition of an FN layer (10 mu g/mL). FN coating was evidenced by X-ray photoelectron analysis. A decrease of contact angle and greater cell adhesion to hydrolyzed, FN-coated PLGA scaffolds were noticed. Suitable degradation behavior without pH variations was observed for all samples up to 28 days. All treated materials presented strong shrinkage, fiber orientation loss, and collapsed fibers. However, functionalization process using 0.01M NaOH concentration resulted in unchanged scaffold porosity, preserved chemical composition, and similar mechanical properties compared with untreated scaffolds. The proposed simplified method to functionalize electrospun PLGA fibers is an efficient route to make polyester scaffolds more biocompatible and shows potential for tissue engineering.","[Campos, Doris M.; Gritsch, Kerstin; Salles, Vincent; Attik, Ghania N.; Grosgogeat, Brigitte] Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR 5615, Lab Multimat & Interfaces, Villeurbanne, France; [Campos, Doris M.; Gritsch, Kerstin; Grosgogeat, Brigitte] Univ Lyon 1, UFR Odontol, Villeurbanne, France; [Gritsch, Kerstin] Univ Lyon 1, Ctr Soins Enseignement & Rech Dentaires, Dept Parodontol, Villeurbanne, France; [Grosgogeat, Brigitte] Univ Lyon 1, Ctr Soins Enseignement & Rech Dentaires, Dept Sante Publ, Villeurbanne, France",Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Chemistry (INC); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1,"Campos, DM (corresponding author), Univ Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR 5615, Lab Multimat & Interfaces,UFR Odontol, 11 Rue Guillaume Paradin, F-69372 Lyon, France.",doris.moura-campos@univ-lyon1.fr,"Gritsch, Kerstin/ABF-8626-2020; GROSGOGEAT, Brigitte/AAE-2810-2019; GROSGOGEAT, Brigitte/C-5841-2018","GROSGOGEAT, Brigitte/0000-0003-2194-7300; Gritsch, Kerstin/0000-0001-7027-3731",Lyon Science Transfert,Lyon Science Transfert,"The authors would like to thank Lyon Science Transfert for financial support, the Biomaterials Laboratory at the University of Geneva for providing hPDL fibroblasts, the Centre Technologique des Microstructures of Lyon 1 (CT mu) for access to the SEM, Olympus Company for confocal microscopy disponibility, and Science et Surface Company for XPS analyses.",,33.0,52,60,0,10,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",2164-7860,,,BIORESEARCH OPEN ACC,BioResearch Open Access,JUN,2014,3.0,3.0,,,,,117.0,126.0,,10.1089/biores.2014.0015,0.0,,,10.0,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,V24LX,24940563.0,"Green Published, gold",,,2025-04-23,WOS:000215159600005,0,

Henceforth, it was possible to develop a number of applications, potential or commercially exploited to date, that will be alluded to in this topical review. A deeper understanding of the characteristics of complex metallic alloys (CMAs) may explain why material made of metals like Al, Cu and Fe offers reduced friction; low solid-solid adhesion came later. It is linked to the surface energy being significantly lower on those materials, in which translational symmetry has become a weak property, that is determined by the depth of the pseudo-gap at the Fermi energy. As a result, friction is anisotropic in CMAs that builds up according to the translation symmetry along one direction, but is aperiodic along the other two directions. A review is given in this article of the most salient data found along these lines during the past two decades or so.","[Dubois, Jean-Marie] Univ Lorraine, UMR CNRS 7198, Inst Jean Lamour, F-54011 Nancy, France; [Belin-Ferre, Esther] Univ Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, UMR CNRS 7614, Lab Chim Phys Matiere & Rayonnement, F-75005 Paris, France",Universite de Lorraine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Chemistry (INC); Sorbonne Universite,"Dubois, JM (corresponding author), Univ Lorraine, UMR CNRS 7198, Inst Jean Lamour, Parc Saurupt,CS 50840, F-54011 Nancy, France.",jean-marie.dubois@univ-lorraine.fr,,,"European Commission [HPR1-CT-1999-00024, G5RD-CT-2001-00584, NMP3-CT-2005-500140, FP7-NMP-2007-SMALL-1]",European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"We thank Dr Julian Ledieu (IJL, Nancy) for a careful reading of the manuscript.

These cracks can be classified into vertical and horizontal ones and they have opposite impact on the properties of TBCs. Vertical cracks reduce the residual stress in the top coat and provide strain tolerance. On the contrary, horizontal cracks trigger delamination of the top coat. However, monitoring methods of cracks generation during APS are rare even though they are strongly desired. Therefore, an in situ, non-contact and non-destructive evaluation method for this objective was developed in this study with the laser acoustic emission (AE) technique by using laser interferometers as a sensor. More AE events could be detected by introducing an improved noise reduction filter and AE event detection procedures with multiple thresholds. Generation of vertical cracks was successfully separated from horizontal cracks by a newly introduced scanning pattern of a plasma torch. Thus, generation of vertical cracks was detected with certainty by this monitoring method because AE events were detected only during spraying and a positive correlation was observed between the development degree of vertical cracks and the total AE energy in one experiment.","[Ito, Kaita; Kuriki, Hitoshi; Enoki, Manabu] Univ Tokyo, Sch Engn, Dept Mat Engn, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; [Araki, Hiroshi; Kuroda, Seiji] Natl Inst Mat Sci, High Temp Mat Unit, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050047, Japan",University of Tokyo; National Institute for Materials Science,"Ito, K (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Sch Engn, Dept Mat Engn, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138656, Japan.",ito@rme.mm.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"; Ito, Kaita/U-1153-2019","Kuroda, Seiji/0000-0002-1601-4699; Ito, Kaita/0000-0002-1438-6982; Enoki, Manabu/0000-0001-6929-114X",MEXT/JSPS KAKENHI Grant [23246124]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23246124] Funding Source: KAKEN,"MEXT/JSPS KAKENHI Grant(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",We thank to Mr Hiraoka and Mr Komatsu for supporting fabrication of our equipment and operation of the APS system.

This paper discusses the design and optimization of a suitable coating structure for the TBCs prepared by atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) using the finite element method. The design and optimization processes comply with the rules step by step, as the structure develops from a simple to a complex one. The research results indicate that the suitable thicknesses of the bond-coating and top -coating are 60-120 pin and 300-420 pin, respectively, for the single ceramic layer YSZINiCoCrAlY APS-TBC. The embedded interlayer (50 wt.%YSZ + 50 wt.%NiCoCrAlY) will further reduce the residual stress without sacrificing the thermal insulation effect. The double ceramic layer was further considered which was based on the single ceramic layer TBC. The embedded interlayer and the upper additional ceramic layer will have a best match between the low residual stress and high thermal insulation effect. Finally, the optimized coating structure was obtained, i.e., the La2Ce2O7(LC)/YSZ/Interlayer/NiCoCrAlY coating structure with appropriate layer thickness is the best choice. The effective thermal conductivity of this optimized LC/YSZ/IL/BL TBC is 13.2% lower than that of the typical single ceramic layer YSZ/BL TBC.

Here, we report covalent grafting of zwitterionic poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) (pSBMA) brushes on the Ti6Al4V substrates to promote the surface-mineralization of hydroxyapatite with enhanced surface mineral coverage and mineral-substrate interfacial adhesion. We first optimized the atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) conditions for synthesizing pSBMA polymers in solution. Well-controlled pSBMA polymers (relative molecular weight up to 26kD, PDI = 1.17) with high conversions were obtained when the ATRP was carried out in trifluoroethanol/ionic liquid system at 60 degrees C. Applying identical polymerization conditions, surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP) was carried out to graft zwitterionic pSBMA brushes (PDI < 1.20) from the Ti6Al4V substrates, generating a stable superhydrophilic and low-fouling surface coating without compromising the bulk mechanic property of the Ti6Al4V substrates. The zwitterionic pSBMA surface brushes, capable of attracting both cationic and anionic precursor ions during calcium phosphate apatite mineralization, increased the surface mineral coverage from 32% to 71%, and significantly reinforced the attachment of the apatite crystals on the Ti6Al4V substrate. This facile approach to surface modification of metallic substrates can be exploited to generate multifunctional polymer coatings and improve the performance of metallic implants in skeletal tissue engineering and orthopedic and dental care.","[Liu, Pingsheng; Domingue, Emily; Ayers, David C.; Song, Jie] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Orthoped & Phys Rehabil, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Worcester, MA 01655 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Worcester,"Song, J (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Orthoped & Phys Rehabil, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Worcester, MA 01655 USA.",jie.song@umassmed.edu,"Liu, Pingsheng/I-1791-2014","Song, Jie/0000-0001-7554-5564; Liu, Pingsheng/0000-0003-0649-5174","National Institutes of Health [R01AR055615]; Science and Technology Fund from the President's Office, University of Massachusetts","National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Science and Technology Fund from the President's Office, University of Massachusetts","The work was supported in part by the National Institutes of Health Grant R01AR055615 and a Science and Technology Fund from the President's Office, University of Massachusetts.",,61.0,51,53,2,149,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1944-8244,1944-8252,,ACS APPL MATER INTER,ACS Appl.

This fact contributes to a decrease in the quality of passivation and to the generation of a significant amount of hazardous liquid waste. Recently, a new eco-innovative process based on Emulsion Pertraction Technology (EFT) is being implemented at industrial scale for selectively removing Zn and Fe from spent passivation baths in order to enhance the lifetime of the Cr (Ill) baths. In this study, the effect of Zn and Fe removal on the electrochemical behaviour of Zn-electroplated steel samples was evaluated by means of polarisation curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements at open circuit potential conditions in 3.5 g/L NaCl solutions. The main objective was to assess the benefits brought by EFT using electrochemical methods. Cr (Ill) passivation baths regenerated using the EFT process have been compared to the bath used in a local industry as well as to fresh and spent baths.

The powders and compacts obtained in these processes were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), density measurements, chemical analyses and Vickers hardness. It was verified that silicon and boron powders are dissolved in the titanium during milling with an iron contamination up to 6.0 at.-%. Furthermore, the use of short milling times and alcohol during the final stages of milling increases the powder yield. Such increasing was obtained even with a high rotary speed (300 rpm), which generally creates higher temperatures and consequently more sticking. After sintering of the as-milled powders, it was indentified mainly the Ti+Ti6Si2B+TiB+Ti5Si3 phases in the Ti-7.5Si-22.5B sintered alloys, which presented hardness values up to 800 HV.

The prepared castings consist of two fundamental parts, i.e., the base and the working surface layer. The base part of the bimetallic casting is typical foundry material, i.e., unalloyed cast steel, whereas the working layer is a plate of austenitic alloy steel sort X2CrNi 18-9. The quality of the joint between the base part and the working layer was evaluated on the basis of ultrasonic non-destructive testing and structure examinations containing metallographic macro- and microscopic studies with the use of a light microscope (LOM) with microhardness measurements and a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with microanalysis of the chemical composition (energy dispersive spectroscopy-EDS). On the basis of the obtained results it was confirmed that the decisive phenomena needed to create a permanent joint between the two components of the bimetallic casting are carbon and heat transport in the direction from the high-carbon and hot base material which was poured into the mold in the form of liquid metal to the low-carbon and cold material of the working layer which was placed in the mold cavity in the form of a monolithic insert.","Silesian Tech Univ, Dept Foundry, PL-44100 Gliwice, Poland",Silesian University of Technology,"Wróbel, T (corresponding author), Silesian Tech Univ, Dept Foundry, Towarowa 7, PL-44100 Gliwice, Poland.",tomasz.wrobel@polsl.pl,"Wróbel, Tomasz/K-5990-2019","Wrobel, Tomasz/0000-0002-4107-188X",,,,,20.0,38,39,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1059-9495,1544-1024,,J MATER ENG PERFORM,J.

The objective of this study is to tailor the properties of polyelectrolyte coated CNPs as a function of molecular weight to achieve a stable and catalytic active dispersion. The coating of CNPs with polyacrylic acid (PAA) has increased the dispersion stability of CNPs and enhanced the catalytic ability. The stability of PAA coating was analyzed using the change in the Gibbs free energy computed by the Langmuir adsorption model. The adsorption isotherms were determined using soft particle electrokinetics which overcomes the challenges presented by other techniques. The change in Gibbs free energy was highest for CNPs coated with PAA of 250 kg/mol indicating the most stable coating. The change in free energy for PAA of 100 kg/mol coated CNPs was 85% lower than the PAA of 250 kg/mol coated CNPs. This significant difference is caused by the strong adsorption of PAA of 100 kg/mol on CNPs. Catalytic activity of PAA-CNPs is assessed by the catalase enzymatic mimetic activity of nanoparticles. The catalase activity was higher for PAA coated CNPs as compared to bare CNPs which indicated preferential adsorption of hydrogen peroxide induced by coating. This indicates that the catalase activity is also affected by the structure of the coating layer.,"[Saraf, Shashank; Neal, Craig J.; Das, Soumen; Barkam, Swetha; McCormack, Rameech; Seal, Sudipta] Univ Cent Florida, Adv Mat Proc & Anal Ctr AMPAC, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Seal, Sudipta] Univ Cent Florida, NanoSci Technol Ctr NSTC, Orlando, FL 32816 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida,"Seal, S (corresponding author), Univ Cent Florida, Adv Mat Proc & Anal Ctr AMPAC, 4000 Cent Florida Blvd, Orlando, FL 32816 USA.",Sudipta.Seal@ucf.edu,"Barkam, Swetha/G-3662-2016; Saraf, Shashank/T-8452-2019; Neal, Craig/JRX-7870-2023; Seal, Sudipta/A-7698-2012","Neal, Craig/0000-0001-7288-4229","NSF NIRT [CBET-0708172]; NSF [EECS - 0901503, EECS - 0801774]; NIH [1R01EY022111]; Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Electrical, Commun & Cyber Sys [0901503] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF NIRT(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Electrical, Commun & Cyber Sys(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG)NSF - Division of Electrical, Communications & Cyber Systems (ECCS))","Part of the nanoparticle research is funded by NSF NIRT (CBET-0708172), NSF (EECS - 0901503), NSF (EECS - 0801774), and NIH (1R01EY022111).",,52.0,19,22,1,36,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1944-8244,,,ACS APPL MATER INTER,ACS Appl.

In previously reported F-SERS tags, organic fluorescent dyes or quantum dots were generally selected to generate fluorescence signal. Herein, we reported the first proof-of-concept upconversion fluorescence (UCF)-SERS dual mode tags based on near infrared (NIR) laser (980 nm) excited upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) for live-cell and in vivo imaging. Three components involved in this tag: NaYF4:Yb,Er UCNPs@SiO2 serving as the fluorescent core of the tag; silver nanoparticles in situ grown on the surface of UCNPs@SiO2 for generating characteristic Raman signal; and denatured BSA coating rendering the tag's stability and biocompatibility. The UCF-SERS tags integrated the NIR imaging capability of both fluorescent UCNPs and plasmonic SERS nanoprobe, which facilitated dual mode bioimaging investigation, especially for living animals. Ex vivo experiments revealed that with 980 nm and 785 nm NIR laser irradiations, the UCF and SERS signals of the tags could be detected from 3 and 7 mm deep pork tissues, respectively. Furthermore, the in vivo imaging capabilities of UCF-SERS tags were successfully demonstrated on living mice.

We have determined in a quantitative way that the key factors are the length and the dispersion states of the DWCNTs as well as the weight-ratios of dispersant polymer/DWCNTs. By controlling such factors, we have readily fabricated a flexible highly transparent (94% transmittance) and conductive (surface resistivity = 320 Omega sq(-1)) DWCNT film without adding any chemical doping that is often used to reduce the surface resistivity.

Slabs consisting of stoichiometric TiN and ZrN and random, as well as segregated, B1-TixZr1-xN(111) solutions were considered. The calculations of the B1-TixZr1-xN solid solutions, as well as of the heterostructures, showed that the pseudo-binary TiN-ZrN system exhibits a miscibility gap. The segregated heterostructures in which Zr atoms surround the SiyNz interface were found to be the most stable. For the Zr-rich heterostructures, the total energy of the random solid solution was lower compared to that of the segregated one, whereas for the Ti-rich heterostructures the opposite tendency was observed. Hard and super hard Zr-Ti-Si-N coatings with thicknesses from 2.8 to 3.5 mu m were obtained using a vacuum arc source with high frequency stimulation. The samples were annealed in a vacuum and in air at 1200 degrees C. Experimental investigations of Zr-Ti-N, Zr-Ti-Si-N and Ti-Si-N coatings with different Zr, Ti and Si concentrations were carried out for comparison with results obtained from TixZr1-xN(111)/SiNy systems. During annealing, the hardness of the best series samples was increased from (39.6 +/- 1.4) to 53.6 GPa, which seemed to indicate that a spinodal segregation along grain interfaces was finished. A maximum hardness of 40.8 GPa before and 55 GPa after annealing in air at 500 degrees C was observed for coatings with a concentration of elements of Si >= (7-8) at.%, Ti >= 22 at.% and Zr <= 70 at.%.","[Ivashchenko, Volodymyr] NAS Ukraine, Inst Problems Mat Sci, UA-03142 Kiev, Ukraine; [Veprek, Stan] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Chem, D-85747 Garching, Germany; [Pogrebnjak, Alexander; Postolnyi, Bogdan] Sumy State Univ, UA-40007 Sumy, Ukraine","National Academy of Sciences Ukraine; G.S.

Zirconia may become a potential candidate to be used as an alternative to titanium dental implants if surface modifications are introduced. In this work, bioactive micropatterned silica coatings were produced on zirconia substrates, using a combined methodology of sol-gel processing and soft lithography. The aim of the work was to compare the in vitro behavior of human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) and human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs) on three types of silica-coated zirconia surfaces: flat and micropatterned (with pillars and with parallel grooves). Our results showed that cells had a higher metabolic activity (HGF, HDMEC) and increased gene expression levels of fibroblast-specific protein-1 (FSP-1) and collagen type I (COL I) on surfaces with pillars. Nevertheless, parallel grooved surfaces were able to guide cell growth. Even capillary tube-like networks of HDMEC were oriented according to the surface geometry. Zirconia and silica with different topographies have shown to be blood compatible and silica coating reduced bacteria adhesion. All together, the results indicated that microstructured bioactive coating seems to be an efficient strategy to improve soft tissue integration on zirconia implants, protecting implants from peri-implant inflammation and improving long-term implant stabilization. This new approach of micropatterned silica coating on zirconia substrates can generate promising novel dental implants, with surfaces that provide physical cues to guide cells and enhance their behavior.","[Laranjeira, Marta S.; Carvalho, Angela; Ferraz, Maria Pia; Monteiro, Fernando Jorge] Univ Porto, INEB Inst Engn Biomed, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal; [Laranjeira, Marta S.; Carvalho, Angela; Monteiro, Fernando Jorge] Univ Porto, DEMM, Fac Engn, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal; [Pelaez-Vargas, Alejandro] Univ Cooperat Colombia, Fac Odontol, Medellin, Colombia; [Hansford, Derek] Ohio State Univ, Dept Biomed Engn BME, Columbus, OH USA; [Ferraz, Maria Pia] Univ Fernando Pessoa, Lab CEBIMED, Ctr Estudos Biomed, Oporto, Portugal; [Coimbra, Susana; Costa, Elisio; Santos-Silva, Alice] Univ Porto, IBMC Inst Biol Mol & Celular, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal; [Coimbra, Susana] CESPU Inst Invest & Formacao Avancada Ciencias &, Gandra Prd, Portugal; [Costa, Elisio; Santos-Silva, Alice] Univ Porto, Fac Farm, Dept Ciencias Biol, Serv Bioquim, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal; [Fernandes, Maria Helena] Univ Porto, Fac Med Dent, Lab Bone Metab & Regenerat, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto; Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Universidade Fernando Pessoa; Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto,"Laranjeira, MS (corresponding author), Univ Porto, INEB Inst Engn Biomed, Rua Campo Alegre 823, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal.",martalaranjeira@gmail.com,"Pelaez-Vargas, Alejandro/AAJ-7370-2021; Hansford, Derek/B-5306-2012; Monteiro, Fernando/ABB-7538-2020; Santos-Silva, Alice/AAC-7082-2020; de Sousa Laranjeira, Marta/K-5566-2013; Coimbra, Susana/K-4466-2013; Fernandes, Maria Helena/K-6917-2014; Carvalho, Angela/L-3224-2014; Ferraz, Maria Pia/M-6316-2013; Costa, Elisio/K-1990-2013; Santos-Silva, Alice/K-2326-2013","Coimbra, Susana/0000-0001-8411-8038; Fernandes, Maria Helena/0000-0001-9391-9574; Carvalho, Angela/0000-0002-4837-6539; Ferraz, Maria Pia/0000-0002-0274-106X; Laranjeira, Marta/0000-0002-7933-1720; Costa, Elisio/0000-0003-1158-1480; Monteiro, Fernando/0000-0002-1361-4605; Pelaez-Vargas, Alejandro/0000-0001-7582-2760; Santos-Silva, Alice/0000-0002-2565-3169","FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (Portugal) [FCT/PTDC/CTM/100120/2008]; NSEC (Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center, USA); FEDER funds through the Programa Operacional Factores de Competitividade-COMPETE; Portuguese funds through FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [PEst-C/SAU/LA0002/2011]","FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (Portugal)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); NSEC (Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center, USA); FEDER funds through the Programa Operacional Factores de Competitividade-COMPETE; Portuguese funds through FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))","The authors would like to thank FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (Portugal) for grant FCT/PTDC/CTM/100120/2008 'Bonamidi' and NSEC (Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center, USA).

In this study, the optimization of the process, including an appropriate heat treatment prone to densify the yttria-stabilized-zirconia (YSZ) top-coat and leading to the sintering and the development of a resulting crack network, is investigated. In particular, relevant information on internal strain evolution during the heat treatment are obtained using in situ synchrotron X-rays diffraction and confirm a stabilization of the TBC through the occurrence of the micro-cracks that beneficially releases the in-plane sintering stress. Such TBCs are subsequently reinforced using additional material brought within the cracks using sol gel spray coating. The effect of various process parameters, such as the pre-oxidation of the bond-coat, on the sol gel TBCs consolidation and their cyclic oxidation resistance enhancement, is presented. Reinforced sol gel TBCs are successfully oxidized up to more than one thousand 1 h-cycles at 1100 C, without any detrimental spallation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The corrosion protection provided by this coating was evaluated through electrochemical tests such as: open circuit potential, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and anodic potentiodynamic polarization in NaCl 0,5 mol L-1 solution. The morphology and composition of the coatings were analyzed using scanning electronic microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray diffractions. A zinc phosphate coating was used as standard test for comparison of results. The electrochemical measurements revealed that: (1) The Nb2O5 coating dislocates the corrosion potential towards more positive values; (2) higher impedance values were found for the Nb2O5 coated samples; and (3) lower current density values were found for these samples. The electronic micrograph revealed that there was alteration in the morphology of the carbon steel surface due to the Nb2O5 deposition. The EDS spectra confirmed the niobium coating deposition, as a peak regarding this element was obtained in the spectra. The X-ray diffractograms confirmed the presence of the phases in the Nb2O5 coating. This new coating increases protection of the carbon steel against corrosion and presents an alternative to replace phosphating.","[Rodrigues, P. R. P.; Junior, O. R. A.; Lopes, A. C.; Banczek, E.

Antifouling surfaces mostly achieved by methoxypoly(ethylene glycol) (mPEG) have shown biomolecular adsorption less than 1 ng/cm(2) which was measured by surface analytical tools such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy, quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), or optical waveguide lightmode (OWL) spectroscopy. Herein, we utilize a single-molecule imaging technique (i.e., an ultimate resolution) to study antifouling properties of functionalized surfaces. We found that about 600 immunoglobulin G (IgG) molecules are adsorbed. This result corresponds to similar to 5 pg/cm(2) adsorption, which is far below amount for the detection limit of the conventional tools. Furthermore, we developed a new antifouling platform that exhibits improved antifouling performance that shows only 78 IgG molecules adsorbed (similar to 0.5 pg/cm(2)). The antifouling platform consists of forming 1 nm TiO2 thin layer, on which peptidomimetic antifouling polymer (PMAP) is robustly anchored. The unprecedented antifouling performance can potentially revolutionize a variety of research fields such as single-molecule imaging, medical devices, biosensors, and others.","[Song, In Taek; Lee, Haeshin] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Chem, Taejon 305701, South Korea; [Ryu, Ji Young; Yoon, Tae-Young] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Natl Creat Res Initiat Ctr Single Mol Syst Biol, Taejon 305701, South Korea; [Ryu, Ji Young; Yoon, Tae-Young] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Phys, Taejon 305701, South Korea; [Lau, K.

Gas phase selective oxidation of rosalva to its aldehyde (costenal) was performed in glass/silicon microstructured reactors at temperatures of 375-475 degrees C on silver catalyst which was deposited on both porous and flat silicon surface by sputter-coating. The effects of temperature (375-475 degrees C), rosalva concentration (1.17%-3.43%), O-2 to rosalva ratio (0.5-20) and residence time on the reaction were investigated. The reactivity of rosalva on the porous silicon supported silver was 5.7-6.4 times higher than on the thin film silver catalyst at 450 degrees C. Furthermore, activation energy for the porous silicon supported silver was lower. Isothermal conditions in the microreactors allowed high conversion and selectivity to be achieved in a wide range of temperature and oxygen concentration. At typical reaction conditions (1.75% rosalva, O-2/rosalva = 3, residence time 18 ms and 450 degrees C), conversion of 97% and selectivity of 95% to costenal was achieved, corresponding to a turnover frequency of 268 h(-1).","[Cao, Enhong; Al-Rifai, Noor; Roydhouse, Mark; Gavriilidis, Asterios] UCL, Dept Chem Engn, Torrington Pl, London WC1E 7JE, England; [Zuburtikudis, Ioannis] TEI Western Macedonia, Dept Mech & Ind Design Engn, Kozani 50100, Greece; [Zuburtikudis, Ioannis] United Arab Emirates Univ, Dept Chem & Petr Engn, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates",University of London; University College London; United Arab Emirates University,"Gavriilidis, A (corresponding author), UCL, Dept Chem Engn, Torrington Pl, London WC1E 7JE, England.",e.cao@ucl.ac.uk; Ioannis.z@uaeu.ac.ae; noor.al-rifai.10@ucl.ac.uk; mroydhouse@googlemail.com; a.gavriilidis@ucl.ac.uk,"Zuburtikudis, Ioannis/H-7962-2019; Gavriilidis, Asterios/G-7353-2011","Gavriilidis, Asterios/0000-0003-3508-5043; Zuburtikudis, Ioannis/0000-0002-5969-8488",EPSRC; EPSRC [EP/J017833/1] Funding Source: UKRI,EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),Financial support from EPSRC is gratefully acknowledged.

The produced pigments from the two methods were investigated physicochemically by several analyses tools. Then they were applied in paper coating mixtures and their influence on coated paper properties was systematically investigated. XRD and FTIR investigations showed that the prepared pigments using hydrothermal method at 100 and 120 degrees C were a mixture of anatase and brookite and pure anatase, respectively, whereas hydrolysis method produced pure rutile phase pigment. TEM investigation showed that the crystallite size of anatase, mixture of anatase and brookite and rutile samples are 6.2, 11.7, and 9.2 nm, respectively. BET studies proved that anatase pigment has 140.74 m(2)/g, 0.237 cc/g and 18.33 angstrom, whereas rutile has 60.621 m(2)/g, 0.122 cc/g and 14.669 angstrom, surface area, pore volume and pore diameter, respectively. UV-Vis absorption and PL emission characteristics of the prepared pigments showed that the energy gaps for anatase, mixture of anatase and brookite and rutile are 3.36, 3.30 and 3.37 eV, respectively. The addition of the prepared nanopigments in conjugation with clay in coating mixture increased both brightness and opacity of the coated papers. The greatest effect was obtained upon using rutile nanopigment. Also there was a significant decrease in coated paper roughness while the air permeance started to decrease then increased at 50 % addition levels. In all coated paper, rutile pigment showed the highest enhancement effect on coated paper properties.","[El-Sherbiny, Samya; Morsy, Fatma; Samir, Marwa] Helwan Univ, Fac Sci, Paper & Printing Lab, Dept Chem, Helwan, Egypt; [Fouad, Osama A.] Cent Met Res & Dev Inst, Adv Mat Dept, Nanostruct Mat & Nanotechnol Lab, Cairo 11421, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Helwan University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Central Metallurgical Research & Development Institute (CMRDI),"El-Sherbiny, S (corresponding author), Helwan Univ, Fac Sci, Paper & Printing Lab, Dept Chem, Helwan, Egypt.",samya.elsherbiny@gmail.com; oafouad@yahoo.com,"Fouad, Osama/G-2625-2014; morsy, fatma/AAC-1032-2020; Samir, Marwa/AAX-9410-2020; El-sherbiny, samya/G-6472-2019","El-sherbiny, samya/0000-0002-4800-4268",,,,,20.0,126,130,2,13,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2190-5509,2190-5517,,APPL NANOSCI,Appl.

This interaction of crystalline copper nanoparticles and copper substrate is modeled, using MD simulation. The quantitative results of the impacts at different velocities and temperatures are evaluated using a newly defined flattening aspect ratio. This ratio between the maximum diameter after the impact and the height of the splat increases with increasing Reynolds numbers until a critical value is reached. At higher Reynolds numbers the flattening aspect ratio decreases again, as the kinetic energy of the particle leads to increasing substrate temperature and, therefore, decreases the substrate resistance. Thus, the particle penetrates into the substrate and deforms less. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B. V.

Uniform coating of the conductive nanomaterials, such as silver nanowires (AgNWs) and carbon nanotubes, is achieved by simple filtration of their aqueous dispersions through the cellulose nanopaper, which acts as both filter and transparent flexible substrate. The as-prepared AgNW networks on the nanopaper offer sheet resistance of 12 Omega sq.(-1) with optical transparency of 88%, which is up to 75 times lower than the sheet resistance on a polyethylene terephthalate film prepared by conventional coating processes. These results indicate that the 'filtration coating' provides uniformly connected conductive networks because of drainage in the perpendicular direction through paper-specific nanopores, whereas conventional coating processes inevitably cause self-aggregation and uneven distribution of the conductive nanomaterials because of the hard-to-control drying process, as indicated by the well-known coffee-ring effect. Furthermore, the conductive networks are embedded in the surface layer of the nanopaper, showing strong adhesion to the nanopaper substrate and providing foldability with negligible changes in electrical conductivity. This filtration process is thus expected to offer an effective coating approach for various conductive materials, and the resulting transparent conductive nanopaper is a promising material for future paper electronics.","[Koga, Hirotaka; Nogi, Masaya; Komoda, Natsuki; Thi Thi Nge; Sugahara, Tohru; Suganuma, Katsuaki] Osaka Univ, Inst Sci & Ind Res, Ibaraki, Osaka 5670047, Japan",The University of Osaka,"Koga, H (corresponding author), Osaka Univ, Inst Sci & Ind Res, 8-1 Mihogaoka, Ibaraki, Osaka 5670047, Japan.",hkoga@eco.sanken.osaka-u.ac.jp; nogi@eco.sanken.osaka-u.ac.jp,"Nge, Thi/ABF-1923-2020; Sugahara, Tohru/AAL-5685-2021; Koga, Hirotaka/F-6308-2016","Sugahara, Tohru/0000-0001-5842-5392; Koga, Hirotaka/0000-0001-6295-1731; Nge, Thi Thi/0000-0001-7201-0222","Japan Science and Technology Agency A-Step Feasibility Study Program (JST A-Step, Japan); Funding Program for Next Generation World-Leading Researchers (NEXT Program, Japan)","Japan Science and Technology Agency A-Step Feasibility Study Program (JST A-Step, Japan); Funding Program for Next Generation World-Leading Researchers (NEXT Program, Japan)","HK and MN were supported by the Japan Science and Technology Agency A-Step Feasibility Study Program (JST A-Step, Japan) and the Funding Program for Next Generation World-Leading Researchers (NEXT Program, Japan), respectively.",,32.0,195,208,5,261,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,NEW YORK,"75 VARICK ST, 9TH FLR, NEW YORK, NY 10013-1917 USA",1884-4049,1884-4057,,NPG ASIA MATER,NPG Asia Mater.,MAR,2014,6.0,,,,,,,,e93,10.1038/am.2014.9,0.0,,,8.0,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Materials Science,AE2NV,,"Green Published, gold",,,2025-04-23,WOS:000333810900005,0,

However, the existence of temperature gradients during growth may compromise the desired uniformity of the final diamond coatings. In the present work, a thick PCD coating was deposited on a 100-mm silicon substrate inside a 915-MHz reactor; the temperature gradient resulted in a non-uniform diamond coating. An attempt was made to relate the local temperature variation during deposition and the different properties of the final coating. It was found that there was large instability inside the system, in terms of substrate temperature (as high as Delta T = 212 degrees C), that resulted in a large dispersion of the diamond coating's final properties: residual stress (-15.8 GPa to +6.2 GPa), surface morphology (octahedral pyramids with (111) planes to cubo-octahedrals with (100) flat top surfaces), thickness (190 mu m to 245 mu m), columnar growth of diamond (with appearance of variety of nanostructures), nucleation side hardness (17 GPa to 48 GPa), quality (Raman peak FWHM varying from 5.1 cm(-1) to 12.4 cm(-1) with occasional splitting). This random variation in properties over large-area PCD coating may hamper reproducible diamond growth for any meaningful technological application.","[Mallik, Awadesh Kumar; Bysakh, Sandip; Sreemany, Monjoy; Roy, Sudakshina; Ghosh, Jiten; Datta, Someswar] Cent Glass & Ceram Res Inst, CSIR, Kolkata 700032, W Bengal, India; [Roy, Soumyendu] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Phys, Bombay 400076, Maharashtra, India; [Mendes, Joana Catarina] Campus Univ Santiago, Inst Telecomunicacoes, P-3810193 Santiago, Portugal; [Gracio, Jose] Univ Aveiro, Ctr Mech Technol & Automat, Nanotechnol Res Div, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal",Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - Central Glass & Ceramic Research Institute (CGCRI); Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay; Universidade de Aveiro,"Mallik, AK (corresponding author), Cent Glass & Ceram Res Inst, CSIR, Kolkata 700032, W Bengal, India.",amallik@cgcri.res.in,"Bysakh, Sandip/AAN-1922-2020; SREEMANY, MONJOY/C-8221-2009; Mendes, Joana Catarina/G-3128-2010; Mallik, Awadesh/C-1465-2010; Roy, Soumyendu/N-4586-2014","Mendes, Joana Catarina/0000-0001-9271-207X; Roy, Soumyendu/0000-0001-7018-7091; Mallik, Awadesh/0000-0003-0499-7269","CSIR, India (CSIR) [NWP 0024, PSC0101]","CSIR, India (CSIR)","CSIR, India provided financial support for the network project Very High Power MW Tubes: Design and Development Capabilities (MTDDC) (CSIR Grant Nos.

Thermogravimetric curves of the BaCO3 particles coated with the TiO2 precursor, prepared from BaCO3 particles of various sizes, show BaTiO3 formation occurring mainly at 550-650 degrees C in the case of fine BaCO3 particles. However, as evidenced from the curves, the temperature of formation of BaTiO3 shifts to higher values with an increase in the size of the BaCO3 particles.

The deposition processes were performed in a home build magnetron sputtering system, using a four-inch pure In target, nitrogen and oxygen as process gases. The pressure was kept constant at 10 mtorr and the RF power (13.56 MHz) was constant at 250 W. The photoconductors were made with these thin films. The photoelectric detectors were analyzed by IxV (current versus voltage) analyses. The IxV analysis presented a low leakage current (10(-8) A). The photoelectric effect was observed from the difference between the case with emitted light and dark currents. It increased around 140 times, under illumination of a halogen lamp. The Hall Effect measurements indicated that the films were n-type semiconductors. The increase in the oxygen concentration added in the plasma, promoted the change in the character of these thin films from conductor to semiconductor material.","[Sparvoli, M.; Mansano, R.

To maintain thermal conductivity, the higher-thermal-conductivity alpha-Al2O3 layer was designed to cover most of the AlN surface, and the lower-thermal-conductivity organic layer was formed on the remaining area. Scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry and thermogravimetric analyses of the particles revealed that the small amount of organic layer was filling the cracks in the alpha-Al2O3 layer. The water resistant property was evaluated by a water immersion test. The pH of water dispersing the particles with hybrid layers was less than that of water dispersing the particles coated only with alpha-Al2O3 or organic layers, which indicated that the particles with hybrid layers had improved water resistance.

Thus, self-healing materials hold great promise for prolonging the lifetime of machines, particularly those in remote locations, as well as in increasing the reliability and safety associated with functional materials in, for example, aeronautics applications. Recent material science applications of self-healing have led to an increased interest in the field and, consequently, the spectroscopic characterization of a wide range of self-healing materials with respect to their mechanical properties such as stress and strain resistance and elasticity was in the focus. However, the characterization of the chemical mechanisms underlying various self-healing processes locally within the damaged region of materials still presents a major challenge. This requires experimental techniques that work non-destructively in situ and are capable of revealing the chemical composition of a sample with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution without disturbing the healing process. Along these lines, vibrational spectroscopy and, in particular Raman spectroscopy, holds great promise, largely due to the high spatial resolution in the order of several hundreds of nanometers that can be obtained. This article aims to summarize the state of the art and prospective of Raman spectroscopy to contribute significant insights to the research on self-healing materials - in particular focusing on polymer and biopolymer materials.","[Zedler, Linda; Schmitt, Michael; Popp, Juergen; Dietzek, Benjamin] Univ Jena, Inst Phys Chem, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Zedler, Linda; Schmitt, Michael; Popp, Juergen; Dietzek, Benjamin] Univ Jena, Abbe Ctr Photon, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Hager, Martin D.; Schubert, Ulrich S.] Univ Jena, IOMC, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Hager, Martin D.; Schubert, Ulrich S.; Popp, Juergen; Dietzek, Benjamin] Univ Jena, JCSM, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Harrington, Matthew J.] Max Planck Inst Colloids & Interfaces, Dept Biomat, D-14424 Potsdam, Germany; [Popp, Juergen; Dietzek, Benjamin] Leibniz Inst Photon Technol Jena eV IPHT, D-07745 Jena, Germany",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Max Planck Society; Leibniz Institut fur Photonische Technologien,"Dietzek, B (corresponding author), Univ Jena, Inst Phys Chem, Helmholtzweg 4, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",benjamin.dietzek@ipht-jena.de,"Schmitt, Michael/AFI-9032-2022; Schubert, Ulrich/B-5777-2009; Hager, Martin D./D-9084-2011","Schmitt, Michael/0000-0002-3807-3630; Schubert, Ulrich/0000-0003-4978-4670; Hager, Martin D./0000-0002-6373-6600",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),The work was financially supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft via the Priority Program SPP 1568 Design and Generic Principles of Self-Healing Materials.,,108.0,57,60,1,76,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-7021,1873-4103,,MATER TODAY,Mater.

The disparate mechanical properties of the two tissues make it difficult to achieve direct surgical repair of the tendon-to-bone insertion. Healing after surgical repair typically does not regenerate the natural attachment, a complex tissue that connects tendon and bone across a gradient in both mineral content and cell phenotypes. To facilitate the regeneration of the attachment, our groups have developed a nanofiber-based scaffold with a graded mineral coating to mimic the mineral composition of the native tendon-to-bone insertion. In the present work, we evaluated the ability of this scaffold to induce graded osteogenesis of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs). Results from 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and proliferating cell nuclear antigen staining indicated that cell proliferation was negatively correlated with the mineral content. In contrast, alkaline phosphatase staining, an indicator of osteogenesis, was positively correlated with the mineral content. Likewise, runt-related transcription factor 2 (an early marker of osteoblast differentiation) and osteocalcin (a late marker of osteoblast differentiation) immunostaining were both positively correlated with the mineral content. These results indicate that a gradient in mineral content on the surface of a nanofiber scaffold is capable of inducing graded differentiation of ASCs into osteoblasts for enthesis repair.","[Liu, Wenying; Xia, Younan] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Chem & Biomol Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Lipner, Justin; Xie, Jingwei] Washington Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Manning, Cionne N.; Thomopoulos, Stavros] Washington Univ, Dept Orthopaed Surg, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Xia, Younan] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Chem & Biochem, Wallace H Coulter Dept Biomed Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Washington University (WUSTL); Washington University (WUSTL); University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Thomopoulos, S (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Dept Orthopaed Surg, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",thomopouloss@wudosis.wustl.edu; younan.xia@biomed.gatech.edu,"liu, yumeng/KIJ-2697-2024; Xia, Younan/E-8499-2011; Su, Yajuan/AAA-3323-2020; Lipner, Justin/D-5489-2011","xie, jingwei/0000-0002-8126-1397; Lipner, Justin/0000-0001-5991-4673",NIH [R01 AR060820]; Georgia Institute of Technology,NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Georgia Institute of Technology,This work was supported in part by a grant from the NIH (R01 AR060820) and startup funds from Georgia Institute of Technology (to Y.X.).

Defect-free and smooth films of V2O5 on different surfaces can be deposited from liquid precursors. We show how pinholes are formed due to heterogeneous nucleation during hydrolysis as the precursor forms a nanofluid. Using knowledge of instability formation often found in composite nanofluid films and the influence of cluster formation on the stability of these films, we show how polymer-precursor mixtures provide optimum uniformity and very low surface roughness in amorphous V2O5 and also orthorhombic V2O5 after crystallization by heating. Pinhole and roughness instability formation during the liquid stage of the nanofluid on gold and ITO substrates is suppressed giving a uniform coating. Practically, understanding evolution pathways that involve dewetting processes, nucleation, decomposition, or hydrolysis in complex nanofluids provides a route for improved uniformity of thin films. The method could be extended to improve the consistency in sequential or iterative multilayer deposits of a range of liquid precursors for functional materials and coatings.","[Glynn, Colm; Creedon, Donal; Geaney, Hugh; O'Connell, John; Holmes, Justin D.; O'Dwyer, Colm] Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Dept Chem, Cork, Ireland; [Glynn, Colm; Geaney, Hugh; O'Connell, John; Holmes, Justin D.; O'Dwyer, Colm] Tyndall Natl Inst, Micro & Nanoelect Ctr, Cork, Ireland; [Holmes, Justin D.] Trinity Coll Dublin, CRANN, Dublin 2, Ireland; [O'Dwyer, Colm] Univ Limerick, Mat & Surface Sci Inst, Limerick, Ireland",University College Cork; University College Cork; Trinity College Dublin; University of Limerick,"O'Dwyer, C (corresponding author), Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Dept Chem, Cork, Ireland.",c.odwyer@ucc.ie,"Glynn, Colm/H-5847-2016; O'Connell, John/J-7919-2015; Geaney, Hugh/K-6695-2019; Holmes, Justin/A-1161-2010; Geaney, Hugh/A-8911-2012; O'Dwyer, Colm/F-9784-2011","Holmes, Justin/0000-0001-5087-8936; O'Connell, John/0000-0002-8712-1862; Geaney, Hugh/0000-0002-9166-5707; O'Dwyer, Colm/0000-0001-7429-015X",Irish Research Council [RS/2011/797]; Seventh Framework Programme FP7 (Project STABLE) [314508]; UCC Strategic Research Fund; Irish Research Council New Foundations Award; SFI under the National Access Programme [NAP 417],"Irish Research Council(Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology); Seventh Framework Programme FP7 (Project STABLE)(European Union (EU)Marie Curie Actions); UCC Strategic Research Fund; Irish Research Council New Foundations Award(Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology); SFI under the National Access Programme(Science Foundation Ireland (SFI))",C.G. acknowledges the support of the Irish Research Council under award RS/2011/797.

A surface plasmon resonance band at 533 nm in the UV-visible spectrum reveals formation of similar to 20 nm spherical GNPs in the non-hydrocolloid. In the FTIR spectrum, selective enhancement in the intensity of C-H stretching and red-shift in the C=O band suggests that PVP encapsulate GNP by an interaction between PVP and GNP that occurs via O-atom of pyrrolidone ring. Raman and XPS spectrum well supports the findings of FTIR spectrum. Zeta potential of -15.22 mV at 7.5 pH found in PVP-capped GNP strongly recommends the role of electrosteric effect towards the observed colloidal stability. Microscopic image demonstrates a thin coating of amorphous PVP layer around GNPs in a core-shell structure.

The minimum IL-1 beta/IL-1Ra ratio obtained was 3.2 +/- 1.3 after 24-h incubation without any beads. ACS has been shown to alleviate clinical symptoms of OA in clinical studies. This descriptive study demonstrated that different pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines are present in ACS since no selective anti-inflammatory cytokines were produced based on the different protocols. Furthermore, we showed that CrSO4-treated glass beads are not necessary and that the absence of beads combined with a 24-h incubation could also lead to an enriched serum.","[Magalon, Jeremy; Bausset, Olivier; Veran, Julie; Giraudo, Laurent; Sabatier, Florence] CHU Concept AP HM, Culture & Therapy Unit, Marseilles, France; [Serratrice, Nicolas; Magalon, Guy] CHU Concept AP HM, Dept Plast & Reconstruct Surg, Marseilles, France; [Magalon, Jeremy; Dignat-George, Francoise; Sabatier, Florence] CHU Concept AP HM, Dept Hematol, Marseille, France",,"Magalon, J (corresponding author), CHU Concept AP HM, 147 Bd Baille, F-13005 Marseille, France.",jeremy.magalon@nck.aphp.fr,"DIGNAT-GEORGE, Francoise/R-1129-2016","DIGNAT-GEORGE, Francoise/0000-0001-7006-4462; Serratrice, Nicolas/0000-0002-9419-1463",,,,,11.0,8,12,0,1,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",2164-7860,,,BIORESEARCH OPEN ACC,BioResearch Open Access,FEB,2014,3.0,1.0,,,,,35.0,38.0,,10.1089/biores.2013.0041,0.0,,,4.0,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,V24JI,24570844.0,"Green Published, gold",,,2025-04-23,WOS:000215152900005,0,

Due to their outstanding characteristics, such as extremely low thermal conductivity, low density, high porosity and high specific surface area, they have found excellent potential application for thermal insulation systems in aeronautical/aerospace and earthly domains, for environment clean up and protection, heat storage devices, transparent windows systems, thickening agents in paints, etc. However, native silica aerogels are fragile and sensitive at relatively low stresses, which limit their application. More durable aerogels, with higher strength and stiffness, can be obtained by proper selection of the silane precursors, and constructing the silica inorganic networks by compounding them with different organic polymers or different fiber networks. Recent studies showed that adding flexible organic polymers to the hydroxyl groups on the silica gel surface would be an effective mechanical reinforcing method of silica aerogels. More versatile polymer reinforcement approach can be readily achieved if proper functional groups are introduced on the surface of silica aerogels and then co-polymerized with appropriate organic monomers. The mechanical reinforced silica aerogels, with their very open texture, can be an outstanding thermal insulator material for different industrial and aerospace applications. This paper presents a review of the literature on the methods for mechanical reinforcing of silica aerogels and discusses the recent achievements in improving the strength and elastic response of native silica aerogels along with cost effectiveness of each methodology.

Ni-base alloys, which are widely used to obtain wear resistant coatings, are usually heat treated after thermal spraying to improve their tribological properties. The dry sling wear experiments were carried out in pin on disc tribometer at room temperature 35 degrees C (308 K), 150 degrees C (423 K), 250 degrees C (523 K) and 350 degrees C (623 K) against medium carbon steel (EN8). The worn surfaces were examined by X-ray diffraction and SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) with EDS (Energy dispersive spectroscopy). The applied load was 40 N and sliding speed was 2 m/s. In 350 degrees C, the wear rate was marginally lesser than the rest of the temperatures due to the initiation of oxide layer formation, which was also substantiated by SEM and EDS. Fe peaks and O peaks were found scarcely. Few Fe peaks were also predominantly noticed by EDS analysis. The presence of Fe3O4 in the tribolayers formed during sliding wear acted as a protective film to retard the wear rate in terms of mass loss.","[Parthasarathi, N.

The cohesive and delamination fatigue properties of 22 nm-thick atomic-layered-deposited (ALD) titania were characterized and compared to that of 25 nm-thick alumina. Both coatings were deposited at 200 degrees C. The fatigue rates are comparable at 30 degrees C, 50% relative humidity (RH) while they are one order of magnitude larger for alumina compared to titania at 80 degrees C, 90% RH. The improved fatigue performance is believed to be related to the improved stability of the ALD titania coating with water compared to ALD alumina, which may in part be related to the fact that ALD titania is crystalline, while ALD alumina is amorphous. Static fatigue crack nucleation and propagation was not observed. The underlying fatigue mechanism is different from previously documented mechanisms, such as stress corrosion cracking, and appears to result from the presence of compressive stresses and a rough coating-substrate interface.","[Sadeghi-Tohidi, Farzad; Samet, David; Graham, Samuel; Pierron, Olivier N.] Georgia Inst Technol, George W Woodruff Sch Mech Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Sadeghi-Tohidi, F (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, George W Woodruff Sch Mech Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",olivier.pierron@me.gatech.edu,"Pierron, Olivier/A-3474-2011",,,,,,32.0,7,9,0,36,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1468-6996,1878-5514,,SCI TECHNOL ADV MAT,Sci.

LRH exhibits the ability to undergo intercalation and anion exchange with DS- (C12H25OSO3-) via hydrothermal treatment. Compared with traditional anion exchange at room temperature, hydrothermal processing not only shortens the anion exchange time from 720 to 24 h but also increases the basal spacing. The arrangements of DS- in the interlayer of LRH are significantly affected by the DS- concentration and reaction temperature, and the basal spacing of the LRH-DS sample in the crystal edge is assumed to be larger than that in the crystal center. A higher DS- concentration and reaction temperature both induce more intercalation of DS- anions into the interlayer gallery, thus yielding a larger basal spacing. Unilamellar nanosheets with a lateral size of >= 60 mu m and a thickness of similar to 1.6 nm can be obtained by delaminating LRH-DS in formamide. The resultant unilamellar nanosheets are single crystalline. Transparent (Y0.95Eu0.05)(2)O-3 phosphor films with a uniform [111] orientation and a layer thickness of similar to 90 nm were constructed with the nanosheets as building blocks via spin-coating, followed by proper annealing. The oriented oxide film exhibits a strong red emission at 614 nm (the D-5(0)-F-7(2) transition of Eu3+), whose intensity is similar to 2 times that of the powder form owing to the significant exposure of the (222) facets.","[Zhu, Qi; Li, Ji-Guang; Li, Xiaodong; Sun, Xudong] Northeastern Univ, Sch Met & Mat, Minist Educ, Key Lab Anisotropy & Texture Mat, Shenyang 110819, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Li, Ji-Guang; Sakka, Yoshio] Natl Inst Mat Sci, Adv Mat Proc Unit, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050047, Japan; [Qi, Yang] Northeastern Univ, Inst Mat Phys & Chem, Sch Sci, Shenyang 110819, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Miaoyong] Northeastern Univ, Sch Mat & Met, Shenyang 110819, Liaoning, Peoples R China",Northeastern University - China; National Institute for Materials Science; Northeastern University - China; Northeastern University - China,"Zhu, Q (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Sch Met & Mat, Minist Educ, Key Lab Anisotropy & Texture Mat, Shenyang 110819, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",LI.Jiguang@nims.go.jp,"qi, yang/H-8625-2016; 朱, 琦/AAJ-3984-2021; Sakka, Yoshio/H-2536-2011","Sakka, Yoshio/0000-0001-8357-5843","National Natural Science Foundation of China [51172038, 50990303]; Special Fund for Basic Research in Central Universities [N110802001, N120302001]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2012M520027, 2013T60291]; Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education [20120042120056]; Liaoning Province Doctor Startup Fund [20131035]; Northeastern University Postdoctoral Science Foundation",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Special Fund for Basic Research in Central Universities; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education(Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China (RFDP)); Liaoning Province Doctor Startup Fund; Northeastern University Postdoctoral Science Foundation,"This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grants 51172038 and 50990303), the Special Fund for Basic Research in Central Universities (grants N110802001 and N120302001), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (grants 2012M520027 and 2013T60291), the Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education (grant 20120042120056), the Liaoning Province Doctor Startup Fund (grant 20131035), and the Northeastern University Postdoctoral Science Foundation.",,41.0,35,37,0,106,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1468-6996,1878-5514,,SCI TECHNOL ADV MAT,Sci.

Our work was focused on the preparation and characterization of their SAM layers they formed on solid surfaces under the different conditions. The molecular films were deposited from organic solvents on different metal surfaces covered by oxide layer. In the case of the layer with double bounds, polymerization of the molecules on the surface with UV light was applied. The modified surfaces were characterized by the wettability and their anti-corrosion activity was determined in linear polarization experiments. According to the numerical results the wettability of the surfaces differed significantly, i.e., we successfully modify the solid surface with the coatings. The anticorrosion activity of the coated surfaces depends on the molecules used for layer deposition. The samples with fluoro-alkyl chains gave the best results, not only their contact angles were very high but their anti-corrosion effectiveness was the best.","[Abohalkuma, T.] Obuda Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Technol, Becsi Ut 96-B, H-1016 Budapest, Hungary; [Abohalkuma, T.; Shawish, F.] Libyan Petr Inst, Tripoli, Libya; [Telegdi, J.] Obuda Univ, Inst Media Technol & Light Ind, H-1034 Budapest, Hungary; [Telegdi, J.] Hungarian Acad Sci, Res Ctr Nat Sci, Inst Mat & Environm Chem, Dept Funct & Struct Mat, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary",Obuda University; Obuda University; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; HUN-REN; HUN-REN Research Centre for Natural Sciences; Institute of Materials & Environmental Chemistry - HAS,"Abohalkuma, T (corresponding author), Obuda Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Technol, Becsi Ut 96-B, H-1016 Budapest, Hungary.",telegdi.judit@ttk.mta.hu,,,,,,,15.0,19,20,0,3,VSEROSSIISKAYA ASSOTSIATSIYA KORROZIONISTOV,MOSCOW,"40 OBRUCHEV ST, BLDG 4, PO BOX 13, MOSCOW, 117342, RUSSIA",2305-6894,,,INT J CORROS SCALE I,Int.

The films were prepared by metal organic decomposition (MOD) technique. The BIG thick film prepared in our previous processing showed the low Faraday rotation which was the same performance of the film with 300 nm. According to our previous preparation process, the crystallization from the amorphous phase to the garnet phase by post annealing was achieved after final spin-coating. We modified the process and repeated the post annealing process after every 5 times coating, then we obtained the thick film with high MO performance. The XRD analysis showed cube on cube crystal growth of the film on the substrate. The Faraday rotation of the film increased in proportion to the thickness of the film. The saturation magnetization was approximately 150 mT. The ferromagnetic resonance indicated the in-plane magnetic anisotropy. The microstructure of the cross section of the film revealed some damage at the interface area between the film and the substrate, which suggests more improvement of the annealing process. However, the BIG thick film prepared by MOD technique has high MO performance for the application for the optical devices. (C)2014 The Ceramic Society of Japan.

Enzyme adsorptions on biosensor electrodes and direct electron transfer between them have been recognized as key factors to affect biosensor performance. TiO2 has a good protein adsorption ability and facilitates having more enzyme adsorption and better electron transfer. In this work, Mg ions are introduced into TiO2 nanodots in order to further improve electrode performance because Mg ions are considered to have good affinity with proteins or enzymes. Mg doped TiO2 nanodots on Ti substrates were prepared by spin-coating and calcining. The effects of Mg doping on the nanodots morphology and performance of the electrodes were investigated. The density and size of TiO2 nanodots were obviously changed with Mg doping. The sensitivity of 2% Mg doped TiO2 nanodots based biosensor electrode increased to 1377.64 from 897.8 mu AmM-1 cm(-2) and its K-M(app) decreases to 0.83 from 1.27 mM, implying that the enzyme achieves higher catalytic efficiency due to better affinity of the enzyme with the Mg doped TiO2.

The microstructures of coating were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as well as the powder precursor. Analysis in the coating showed the formation of an amorphous matrix with boron and tungsten carbides randomly dispersed. At high amplifications were identified boron carbides at interface boron carbide/amorphous matrix by TEM. This kind of carbides growth can be attributed to partial crystallization by heterogeneous nucleation. These interfaces have not been reported in the literature by thermal spraying process. The measurements of average microhardness on amorphous matrix and boron carbides were 9.1 and 23.85 GPa, respectively. By contrast, the microhardness values of unmelted boron carbide in the amorphous phase were higher than in the substrate, approaching 2.14GPa. The relative wear resistance of coating was 5.6 times that of substrate. These results indicate that the twin wire arc spraying is a promising technique to prepare amorphous crystalline coatings.","[Arizmendi-Morquecho, Ana; Campa-Castilla, Araceli; Leyva-Porras, C.] SC Unidad Monterrey, Ctr Invest Mat Avanzados, Apodaca 66600, NL, Mexico; [Aguilar Martinez, Josue Almicar] Univ Autonoma Nuevo Leon, Fac Ingn Mecan & Elect, Ctr Invest & Innovac Ingn Aeronaut, Apodaca 66600, NL, Mexico; [Vargas Gutierrez, Gregorio] Ctr Invest & Estudios Avanzados IPN, Unidad Saltillo, Ramos Arizpe 25900, COAH, Mexico; [Moreno Bello, Karla Judith] Inst Tecnol Celaya, Celaya 38010, GTO, Mexico; [Lopez Lopez, L.] Corp Mexicana Invest Mat, SA CV, Saltillo 25260, Coahuila, Mexico",Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon; CINVESTAV - Centro de Investigacion y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Politecnico Nacional; Corporacion Mexicana de Investigacion en Materiales S.A. de C.V.,"Campa-Castilla, A (corresponding author), SC Unidad Monterrey, Ctr Invest Mat Avanzados, Alianza Norte 202, Apodaca 66600, NL, Mexico.",aracely.campa@cimav.edu.mx,"Lopez, Lucas/JKI-8178-2023; Martínez, Josué/L-2126-2013; Leyva-Porras, Cesar/C-3757-2019; Bello, Karla/P-7445-2015; ARIZMENDI-MORQUECHO, ANA/AAD-5169-2022","ARIZMENDI-MORQUECHO, ANA/0000-0002-1861-6239",Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT-Mexico),Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT-Mexico)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)),Araceli Campa-Castilla gratefully acknowledges the financial support from the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT-Mexico) for the doctoral grant.

Despite its thermal advantages, low cost, and ease of application, this system has serious problems of biological growth causing the cladding defacement. Recent studies pointed that biological growth is due to high values of surface moisture content, which mostly results from the combined effect of exterior surface condensation, wind-driven rain, and drying process. Based on numerical simulation, this paper points the most critical parameters involved in hygrothermal behaviour of ETICS, considering the influence of thermal and hygric properties of the external rendering, the effect of the characteristics of the facade, and the consequences of the exterior and interior climate on exterior surface condensation, wind-driven rain, and drying process. The model used was previously validated by comparison with the results of an in situ campaign. The results of the sensitivity analyses show that relative humidity and temperature of the exterior air, atmospheric radiation, and emissivity of the exterior rendering are the parameters that most influence exterior surface condensation. Wind-driven rain depends mostly on horizontal rain, building's height, wind velocity, and orientation. The drying capacity is influenced by short-wave absorbance, incident solar radiation, and orientation.","[Barreira, Eva; de Freitas, Vasco P.] Univ Porto FE UP, Fac Engn, Civil Engn Dept DEC, Lab Bldg Phys LFC, P-4200465 Oporto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto,"Barreira, E (corresponding author), Univ Porto FE UP, Fac Engn, Civil Engn Dept DEC, Lab Bldg Phys LFC, Rua Dr Roberto Frias, P-4200465 Oporto, Portugal.",barreira@fe.up.pt,"; de Freitas, Vasco P./B-4948-2013","Barreira, Eva/0000-0002-1343-5578; de Freitas, Vasco P./0000-0003-3913-0868",Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT) [SFRH/BD/39904/2007]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BD/39904/2007] Funding Source: FCT,Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),The authors would like to thank the financial support of Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT) that allowed the necessary conditions to carry out this study (Doctoral Grant SFRH/BD/39904/2007).,,34.0,41,43,0,40,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1687-8434,1687-8442,,ADV MATER SCI ENG,Adv.

Defects or cracks in the surface of glass fiber threaten the mechanical strength of the fiber that deteriorates the durability of glass fiber. Coating can play crucial role by forming single or multiple molecular layers on the glass fiber in rectifying the surface flaws and modify surface properties of glass fiber either online or offline. In this experiment, coating was introduced on the fiber surface by continuous impregnation of fiber with a solution of polymer in a padder in order to improve the mechanical strength of glass fibers.

The UV-Vis spectra gave surface plasmon resonance at 434-436 nm of the NPs synthesized with AgNO3 10mM and all extract volumes tested, showing a direct relationship between extract volumes and quantity of particles formed. In contrast, the concentration of silver ions was related negatively to particle size. The smallest (4.9 +/- 3.4 nm) particles were obtained with 1mL of extract in AgNO3 10mM and the larger amount of particles were obtained with 2mL and 5mL of extract.

In this study, the electrodeposition of Ni-Mn alloy in nickel sulphamate electrolyte with the addition of manganese sulphate was investigated under direct current (DC) power source. The effects of current density and Mn2+ concentration in the electrolyte on the coating composition, cathodic efficiency, microstructure and mechanical properties were explored. The results showed that the raise of the Mn2+ concentration in the electrolyte alone did not effectively increase the Mn content in the coating but reduce the cathodic efficiency. On the other hand, increasing the current density facilitated the codeposition of the Mn and rendered the crystallite from coarse columnar grain to the refined one. Thus, both hardness and internal stress of the coating increased. The fabrication of testing probes at 1 A/dm(2) was shown to satisfy the high hardness, low internal stress, reasonable fatigue life, and nonsticking requirements for this microelectronic application.","[Cheng, Kuan-Hui; Lee, Chun-Ying; Huang, Jung-Tang] Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Taipei 10608, Taiwan; [Chen, Fu-Je; Lin, Chao-Sung] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Lan, Chang-Cheng; Tsou, Ping-Huan; Ho, Tzu-I] CCP Contact Probes Co Ltd, Taipei 22061, Taiwan",National Taipei University of Technology; National Taiwan University,"Lee, CY (corresponding author), Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Taipei 10608, Taiwan.",leech@ntut.edu.tw,,"Lee, Chun-Ying/0000-0002-5001-3542","Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan [101-EC-17-A-05-S1-178]","Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan(Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan)","The financial support from Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan, under Grant no. 101-EC-17-A-05-S1-178 is gratefully acknowledged.",,14.0,14,15,0,15,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1687-8434,1687-8442,,ADV MATER SCI ENG,Adv.

Wafer-scale polystyrene (PS) monolayer colloidal crystal was developed as templates by spin-coating method. Metallic shadow mask was prepared by lifting off the oxygen etched PS beads from the deposited chromium film. Nanohole arrays were fabricated by Si dry etching. A series of nanohole arrays were fabricated with the similar diameter but with different depth. It is found that the maximum depth of the Si-hole was determined by the diameter of the Cr-mask. The antireflection ability of these Si-hole arrays was investigated. The results show that the reflection decreases with the depth of the Si-hole. The deepest Si-hole arrays show the best antireflection ability (reflection < 9%) at long wavelengths (>600 nm), which was about 28 percent of the nonpatterned silicon wafer's reflection. The proposed method has the potential for high-throughput fabrication of patterned Si wafer, and the low reflectivity allows the application of these wafers in crystalline silicon solar cells.","[Di, Di; Wu, Xuezhong; Dong, Peitao; Wang, Chaoguang; Chen, Jian; Wang, Haoxu; Wang, Junfeng; Li, Shengyi] Natl Univ Def Technol, Coll Mech & Automat, Changsha 410073, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Dong, Peitao] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Transducer Technol, Shanghai 200050, Peoples R China",National University of Defense Technology - China; Chinese Academy of Sciences,"Dong, PT (corresponding author), Natl Univ Def Technol, Coll Mech & Automat, Changsha 410073, Hunan, Peoples R China.",ptdong@nudt.edu.cn,"Wang, Haoxu/AEV-4909-2022; Wang, Chaoguang/HTL-5236-2023",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [91023028]; Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Transducer Technology [SKT1201],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Transducer Technology,The authors would like to thank the financial support provided by National Natural Science Foundation of China (91023028) and the Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Transducer Technology (SKT1201).,,24.0,11,12,0,35,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1687-4110,1687-4129,,J NANOMATER,J.

The postannealing treatments were investigated on morphologies and photoluminescence (PL) properties of the ZnO thin films. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) results indicate that the thin films composed by ZnO nanoparticles were distributed uniformly on PSi. The average sizes of ZnO nanoparticle increase with increasing annealing temperature. Atomic force microscopic (AFM) analysis reveals that ZnO thin films annealed at 500 C had the smoothest surface. PL spectra show two peaks that completely correspond to nanostructured ZnO and PSi. These findings indicate that the ZnO nanostructures grown on PSi are promising for application as light emitting devices.","[Eswar, K. A.; Rouhi, J.; Husairi, H.

The artists who revived the subjects and forms of Antiquity have been labelled as 'Classical Painters' and 'Olympians' because of their supposed idealization of Antiquity. And yet the term 'Olympian' is highly problematic as it evacuates the ambivalence that characterizes that painting. Such taxonomy indeed evokes the Apollonian while precluding the Dionysian dimension that is in fact present in some of their representations of the antique body. This article first draws on examples taken from Frederic Leighton's production to show the conflict between the Greek ideal as propounded by the neo-Winckelmannian aesthetic and academic tradition and a more controversial vision of Greek culture exploring more unconventional aspects of paganism. Leighton was in fact deeply influenced by Walter Pater's revision of Greek culture. Lawrence Alma-Tadema also aimed at exploring the pagan and Dionysian dimensions in his own representations of rituals. The return to Greece in painting was therefore riddled with contradictions, but it contributed to the redefinition of the aesthetics associated with Antiquity.","[Gillard-Estrada, Anne-Florence] Univ Rouen, F-76821 Mont St Aignan, France",Universite de Rouen Normandie,"Gillard-Estrada, AF (corresponding author), Univ Rouen, F-76821 Mont St Aignan, France.",,,,,,,,5.0,0,0,1,1,"UNIV P MONTPELLIERI III-PAUL VALERY, SERVICES PUBLICATIONS",MONTPELLIER-CEDEX 1,"ROUTE MENDE, BP 5043, 34032 MONTPELLIER-CEDEX 1, FRANCE",0220-5610,,,CAH VICTOR EDOUARD,Cah.

Formulations of textile coatings were prepared with up to 15 wt % of CNT, based on the solid weight of the binder. The binders are water based polyacrylate dispersions. The CNTs were mixed into the binder dispersion starting from a commercially available aqueous CNT dispersion that is compatible with the binder dispersion. Coating formulations with variable CNT concentrations were applied on polyester and cotton woven and knitted fabrics by different textile coating techniques: direct coating, transfer coating, and screen printing. The coatings showed increasing electrical conductivity with increasing CNT concentration. The coatings can be regarded to be electrically conductive (sheet resistivity < 10(3) Ohm/sq) starting at 3 wt% CNT. The degree of dispersion of the carbon nanotubes particles inside the coating was visualized by scanning electron microscopy. The CNT particles form honeycomb structured networks in the coatings, proving a high degree of dispersion.

Colloidal stability in GER fluid can influence the GER performance and the fluid flow steadiness. We investigated the sedimentation effect of the GER particles suspended in various carrier liquid. Different from the existing electrorheological (ER) fluids, GER particles consisting of oxalate core with urea coating are found oil synergistic. The sedimentation effect of the particles suspended in oils from the family of synthetic oil and mineral oil were checked by direct observation. The rheological behavior of the GER fluid upon electric field application was also investigated. These experiments showed that stable colloidal suspension and good GER effect can be achieved coherently by favorable particle oil interaction. The resultant high yield stress and low sedimentation rate achieved due to the instrumental linking of hydrogen bond is showed in the hydrogenated silicone oil carrier liquid. With the anti-sedimentation characteristic upon the new carrier oil, hydrogenated silicone oil-GER fluid, we investigated their GER effect in a modified mono tube damper and the experimental result showed wide controllability range.

The tribological properties of the films were characterized on an UMT-2MT tribometer. The results demonstrated that the film became smoother and denser with increasing the applied bias voltage up to -200 V, whereas surface roughness increased due to the enhancement of ion bombardment as the applied bias voltage further increased. The sp(3) carbon fraction in the films monotonously decreased with increasing the applied bias voltage. The film exhibited moderate hardness and the superior tribological properties at the applied bias voltage of -100 V.

The material property change method is employed to model TGO formation cycle by cycle, and the creep properties for constituent materials are also incorporated. Two columns of repeated nodes are placed along the interface of the potential crack, and these nodes are bonded together as one node at a geometrical location. In terms of critical crack opening displacement criterion, onset of crack propagation in TGO layer has been determined by finite element analyses in comparison with that without predefined crack. Then, according to the results from the previous analyses, the input values for the critical failure parameters for the subsequent analyses can be decided. The robust capabilities of restart analysis in ABAQUS help to implement the overall simulation for TGO crack propagation. The comparison of the TGO final deformation profile between numerical and experimental observation shows a good agreement indicating the correctness and effectiveness of the present procedure, which can guide the prediction of the failure in TGO for the future design and optimization for TBC system.","[Jun, Ding; Xia, Huang; Song, Chen; E-Chuan, Yang] Chongqing Univ Technol, Coll Mech Engn, Chongqing 400054, Peoples R China; [Jun, Ding] Minist Educ, Key Lab Mfg & Test Tech Automobile Parts, Chongqing 400054, Peoples R China",Chongqing University of Technology,"Jun, D (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ Technol, Coll Mech Engn, Chongqing 400054, Peoples R China.",dingjunawen@126.com,"Song, Chen/H-6615-2015",,"Natural Science Foundation of China [11302272, 11272368]; Program for Innovation Team Building at Institutions of Higher Education in Chongqing [KJTD201319]; Science and Technology Project; Education Department of Chongqing Municipality [KJ120801]",Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program for Innovation Team Building at Institutions of Higher Education in Chongqing; Science and Technology Project; Education Department of Chongqing Municipality,"This work is financially supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (11302272), by the Natural Science Foundation of China (11272368), by the 2013 Program for Innovation Team Building at Institutions of Higher Education in Chongqing (KJTD201319), and by the Science and Technology Project Affiliated with the Education Department of Chongqing Municipality (KJ120801).",,22.0,1,1,0,47,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1687-8434,1687-8442,,ADV MATER SCI ENG,Adv.

We fabricated titania nanosheet (TNS) structures on titanium surfaces by NaOH treatment to improve bone differentiation on titanium alloy implants. The cellular response to TNSs on Ti6Al4V alloy was investigated, and the ability of the modified surfaces to affect osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow cells and increase the success rate of titanium implants was evaluated. The nanoscale network structures formed by alkali etching markedly enhanced the functions of cell adhesion and osteogenesis-related gene expression of rat bone marrow cells. Other cell behaviors, such as proliferation, alkaline phosphatase activity, osteocalcin deposition, and mineralization, were also markedly increased in TNS-modified Ti6Al4V. Our results suggest that titanium implants modified with nanostructures promote osteogenic differentiation, which may improve the biointegration of these implants into the alveolar bone.","[Komasa, Satoshi; Nishizaki, Hiroshi; Okazaki, Joji] Osaka Dent Univ, Dept Removable Prosthodont & Occlus, Hirakata, Osaka 5731121, Japan; [Kusumoto, Tetsuji; Kawazoe, Takayoshi] Osaka Dent Univ, Dept Fixed Prosthodont & Occlus, Hirakata, Osaka 5731121, Japan; [Taguchi, Yoichiro; Umeda, Makoto] Osaka Dent Univ, Dept Periodontol, Hirakata, Osaka 5731121, Japan; [Sekino, Tohru] Osaka Univ, Inst Sci & Ind Res, Ibaraki, Osaka 5670047, Japan",The University of Osaka,"Komasa, S (corresponding author), Osaka Dent Univ, Dept Removable Prosthodont & Occlus, 8-1 Kuzuha Hanazono Cho, Hirakata, Osaka 5731121, Japan.",komasa-s@cc.osaka-dent.ac.jp,"Sekino, Tohru/AAP-3330-2021","Sekino, Tohru/0000-0002-6605-9166","Oral Implant Research Grant from Osaka Dental University [14-3]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [24592942, 26861664]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25107704, 26861664, 24592942] Funding Source: KAKEN","Oral Implant Research Grant from Osaka Dental University; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The authors thank Dr. Tohru Sekino from Tohoku University for making the nanosheets and for helpful suggestions.

The residual stress cannot be identified by X-ray technique for amorphous polymer and layer with domains of crystalline TiN. It is assumed that the buffer biocompatible thin film of Au in the TiN/Bionate II material system will alter the evolution of residual stress and, therefore, will allow to determine the residual stress in profilometry studies, and helps to improve toughness of the connection between TiN and Bionate II. The introduction of Au nanocoating in the material system results in bending of the sample and a compressive residual stress in the TiN coating. Results of finite element simulation show improvement of connection between the polymer and TiN, and an increase of compressive residual stress in the coating by introduction of Au nanointerlayer results in reduction of stress and strain in the substrate (close to the boundary between substrate and coating).","[Kopernik, Magdalena; Milenin, Andrzej; Kac, Slawomir; Wrobel, Miroslaw] AGH Univ Sci & Technol, PL-30059 Krakow, Poland",AGH University of Krakow,"Kopernik, M (corresponding author), AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Al Mickiewicza 30, PL-30059 Krakow, Poland.",kopernik@agh.edu.pl,"Kopernik, Magdalena/B-8460-2011; Milenin, Andrij/E-6841-2010","Milenin, Andrij/0000-0002-6266-2881; /0000-0001-8705-6506",National Science Center in Poland [2011/01/D/ST8/04087],"National Science Center in Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)","Financial assistance of the National Science Center in Poland, Project no. 2011/01/D/ST8/04087, is acknowledged.

The doping process was carried out by mixing the BCG and the PEDOT: PSS in a solution with an optimum ratio of 1 : 1 in volume. The sensor was fabricated by using spin-coating technique followed by annealing process. For comparison, the BCG thin film and the PEDOT: PSS thin film were also deposited with the same method on glass substrates. For optical characterization, a red-light laser diode with a 650 nm wavelength was used as light source. Under illumination with the laser diode, the bare glass substrate and BCG film showed no absorption. The sensor exhibited linear response to ammonia gas for the range of 200 ppm to 800 ppm. It increased the sensitivity of sensor based on PEDOT: PSS with BCG doping being about twofold higher compared to that of without BCG doping. Furthermore, the response time and the recovery time of the sensor were found very fast.

However, this reduction in scale to a microlevel means that the influence of friction and the need for suitable lubrication are greatly increased. This study therefore looks at the use of a low-friction and highly wear resistant Graphit-ic coating on the mold-forming section of a microextrusion mold, this coating being applied by a closed-field unbalanced magnetron sputter ion plating technique. A microcup of CuZn33 brass alloy was then extruded, with a wall thickness of 0.45 mm, outside diameter of 2.9 mm, and an internal diameter of 2 mm. The experimental results in which extrusion uses the mold coating with Graphit-ic film are compared against the experimental results in which extrusion uses the mold uncoating with Graphit-ic film. This showed that the load was decreased a lot and the self-lubricating solid coating facilitates a smooth extrusion process. As the extrusion rate was quite high, smoothed particle hydrodynamics method simulations of the extrusion process were conducted, these being then compared with the experimental results. These result showed that the SPH simulation can be applied to show the deformation of materials and predict the load trend.","[Li Shi-Cheng; Zheng Jie; Wang Dong-Feng] Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol, Sch Mech Engn, Shanghai 200093, Peoples R China; [Chen Ze-Zhong] Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200093, Peoples R China",University of Shanghai for Science & Technology; University of Shanghai for Science & Technology,"Chen, ZZ (corresponding author), Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200093, Peoples R China.",xtulsc@qq.com,,,Innovation Fund Project for Graduate Student of Shanghai [JWCXSL1302],Innovation Fund Project for Graduate Student of Shanghai,"This research was supported by The Innovation Fund Project for Graduate Student of Shanghai (Grant no.

Hydrogen plasma, thermal, and surfactant treatment techniques were employed to improve the dispersion characteristics of detonation nanodiamond particles in aqueous media. Theseeding of silicon substratewas then carried outwith an optimized spin-coatingmethod. Theresults of both Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering measurements demonstrated that plasma treated diamond nanoparticles possessed polar surface functional groups and attained high dispersion in methanol.

This article depicts dependence of adhesion strength of as-sprayed nanostructured YSZ coatings on particle temperature, velocity and size of the splat prior to impact on the metallic substrate. Particle temperature measurement is based on two-color pyrometry and particle velocities are measured from the length of the particle traces during known exposure times. The microstructure and adhesion strength of as-sprayed nano-YSZ coatings were studied. Field emission scanning electron microscopy results revealed that morphology of coating exhibits bimodal microstructure consisting of nano-zones reinforced in the matrix of fully melted particles. The coating adhesion strength is noticed to be greatly affected by the melting state of agglomerates. Maximum adhesion strength of 42.39 MPa has been experimentally found out by selecting optimum levels of particle temperature and velocity. The enhanced bond strength of nano-YSZ coating may be attributed to higher interfacial toughness due to cracks being interrupted by adherent nano-zones.","[Mantry, S.; Jha, B. B.; Mishra, B.

TiO2 layers were synthesized by a nonaqueous sol-gel dip-coating method on stainless steel 316L substrates applying two different precursors and their combination. Morphology and topography of newly formed biomaterials were determined as well as chemical composition and elemental distribution of a surface samples. In vitro tests were conducted by adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells cultured on TiO2 coatings and stainless steel without coatings to assess the bioreactivity of obtained materials. A positive biological effect of TiO2/316L/1 coatings-based on titanium(IV) ethoxide-was found in both in vitro and in vivo models. The TiO2/316L/1 exhibited the highest roughness and the lowest titanium concentration in TiO2 than TiO2/316L/2-based on titanium(IV) propoxide and TiO2/316L/3-based on both above-mentioned precursors. The proper fibroblast-like morphology and higher proliferation rate of cells cultured on TiO2/316L/1 were observed when compared to the other biomaterials. No inflammatory response in the bone surrounding implant covered by each of the obtained TiO2 was present.

The electrospinning process of the fibers has been monitored and RF characterized in real time, and it has been shown that the diameters of the fibers depend mainly on two variables: the applied voltage and the distance between the needle and the collector, since all the electrospun fibers have been characterized by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Real-time measurement during the fiber coating process has shown that the depth of penetration of mechanical perturbation in the fiber layer has a limit. It has been demonstrated that once this saturation has been reached, the increase of the thickness of the fibers coating does not improve the sensitivity of the sensor. Finally, the parameters used to deposit the electrospun fibers of smaller diameters have been used to deposit fibers on a SAW device to obtain a sensor to measure different concentrations of toluene at room temperature. The present sensor exhibited excellent sensitivity, good linearity and repeatability, and high and fast response to toluene at room temperature.","[Matatagui, D.; Fernandez, M. J.; Santos, J.

The cross plane thermal transport of four polycrystalline molybdenum nanofilms with different thickness deposited on glass substrates has been studied by applying the picosecond laser transient thermoreflectance technique. The measurement is performed by applying both front pump-front probe and rear pump-front probe configurations with high quality signal. The determined cross plane thermal diffusivity of the Mo films greatly decreases compared to the corresponding bulk value and tends to increase as films become thicker, exhibiting significant size effect. The main mechanism responsible for the thermal diffusivity decrease of the present polycrystalline Mo nanofilms is the grain boundary scattering on the free electrons.

The best electrical properties were obtained with use of a precursor that consisted of poly-N-vinylformamide modified with pyromellitic acid (PMA). We demonstrate that these properties originate from a specific morphology of this layer that showed nanopores (3-4 nm) capable of assuring easy pathways for ion transport in real electrode materials. The proposed, water mediated, method of carbon coating of powdered supports combines coating from solution and solid phase and is easy to scale up process. The optimal polymer carbon precursor composition was used to prepare conductive carbon nanocoatings on LiFePO4 cathode material.

Methods: A comparative, biased selection of commercially available antimicrobial coatings was tested for antimicrobial efficiency. Suppliers were contacted to deliver their coatings on glass and/or stainless steel substrates. In total, 23 coatings from eleven suppliers were received, which were investigated for their effect on the growth of Escherichia coli, using the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 22196 protocol. Results: The majority of nanomaterial-containing coatings (n= 13) contained nanosilver (n= 12), while only one had photocatalytic TiO2 as the active particle. The differences in antimicrobial activity among all of the coatings, expressed as log reduction values, varied between 1.3 and 6.6, while the variation within the nanomaterial-based group was between 2.0 and 6.2. Although nanosilver coatings were on average very effective in reducing the number of viable bacteria after challenge, the strongest log reduction (6.6) was seen with a coating that has immobilized, covalently bound quaternary ammonium salt in its matrix. Besides these two compounds, coatings containing TiO2, poly(dimethylsiloxane), triclosan, or zinc pyrithione evoked 100% killing of E. coli. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that nanosilver dominates the nanoparticle-based coatings and performs adequately. However, considering the unknowns in relation to ecotoxicological emission and effects, it needs further consideration before widespread application into different environments.","[Molling, Johan W.; Seezink, Jacques W.; Teunissen, Birgit Ej; Muijrers-Chen, Inhua; Borm, Paul J.

Two types of bond coat were prepared by different methods, namely, air plasma spray (APS) and high-velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF), and two kinds of feedstock powder were employed for preparing the top coat in APS process. The better thermal durability was achieved in the vertically cracked TBC with the surface modified bond coat or with the bond coat prepared by APS process. The hardness and fracture toughness values of TBCs increased because of densification of the top coat during cyclic thermal exposure, and the bond coat prepared by HVOF process showed higher values than that by APS process. The TBCs with the surface modified bond coat were more efficient in improving adhesive strength than those without plasma pretreatment on the bond coat. The relationship between microstructure evolution and thermomechanical characteristics of TBCs with plasma pretreatment was discussed in cyclic thermal exposure.","[Myoung, Sang-Won; Lu, Zhe; Jung, Yeon-Gil] Changwon Natl Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Chang Won 641773, Gyeongnam, South Korea; [Jang, Byung-Koog] Natl Inst Mat Sci, High Temp Mat Unit, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050047, Japan; [Yoo, Young-Soo; Seo, Seong-Moon; Choi, Baig-Gyu; Jo, Chang-Yong] Korea Inst Mat Sci, High Temp Mat Res Grp, Chang Won 641831, Gyeongnam, South Korea",Changwon National University; National Institute for Materials Science; Korea Institute of Materials Science (KIMS),"Jung, YG (corresponding author), Changwon Natl Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, 20 Changwondaehakro, Chang Won 641773, Gyeongnam, South Korea.",jungyg@changwon.ac.kr,"Jang, Byung-Koog/S-9510-2019",,"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIP) [2011-0030058]; Human Resources Development program [20134030200220]; Technology Innovation Program - Korea government Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy [10043795]; Korea Institute of Materials Science (KIMS)","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIP); Human Resources Development program; Technology Innovation Program - Korea government Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy; Korea Institute of Materials Science (KIMS)","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant funded by the Korean government (MSIP) (2011-0030058), by the Human Resources Development program (20134030200220) and the Technology Innovation Program (10043795) funded by the Korea government Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, and by the Korea Institute of Materials Science (KIMS) in 2013.",,17.0,2,2,0,10,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1687-8434,1687-8442,,ADV MATER SCI ENG,Adv.

So, the rheological study of various coatings with different concentration of apatite powder, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and water under different conditions regarding temperature and stirring time was done. It was found that the suitable suspension should follow a rheo-thickner behavior having a viscosity in the range of 30-35 mP a s at room temperature of 25 to 30 degrees C. The optimum conditions then found to achieve these properties were: a suspension of 4% of apatite, 40% of PVA stirred for 180miutes.

Due to temperature rise of PFPE Zdol lubricant molecules on a DLC surface, how polar end groups are detached from lubricant molecules during coating is described considering the effect of temperatures on the bond/break density of PFPE Zdol using the coarse-grained bead spring model based on finitely extensible nonlinear elastic potential. As PFPE Z contains no polar end groups, effects of temperature on the bond/break density (number of broken bonds/total number of bonds) are not so significant like PFPE Zdol. Effects of temperature on the bond/break density of PFPE Z on DLC surface are also discussed with the help of graphical results. How bond/break phenomenonaffects the end bead density of PFPE Z and PFPE Zdol on DLC surface is discussed elaborately. How the overall bond length of PFPE Zdol increases with the increase of temperature which is responsible for its decomposition is discussed with the help of graphical results. At HAMR condition, as PFPE Z and PFPE Zdol are not suitable lubricant on a hard disk surface, it needs more investigations to obtain suitable lubricant. We study the effect of breaking of bonds of nonfunctional lubricant PFPE Z, functional lubricants such as PFPE Zdol and PFPE Ztetrao, andmultidented functional lubricants such as ARJ-DS, ARJ-DD, and OHJ-DS on a DLC substrate with the increase of temperature when heating of all of the lubricants on a DLC substrate is carried out isothermally using the coarse-grained bead spring model by molecular dynamics simulations and suitable lubricant is selected which is suitable on a DLC substrate at high temperature.","[Nath, S.

In this study, ethylperfluorobutylether (EFE), which is a kind of hydrofluoroether, was applied as the solvent for preparing a particle suspension for the EPD. EFE has the advantages of being polar, non-flammable, and having high electrical insulation properties. Silica powder was selected as the deposition material. When EFE is used, unlike when acetone-based EPD suspension was used, the amount deposited remains the same, but power consumption is 1/2,000 or less. Depending on conditions, power consumption is reducible even to 1/200,000. Thus, highly efficient EPD with ultra power saving ability was achieved. In addition, this process is extremely safe as EFE is non-flammable, removing the hazard of ignition. As the specific gravity of EFE is large, sedimentation of inorganic particles is slow; therefore, the dispersibility is excellent, and highly uniform coatings can be obtained. Unlike water-based EPD suspensions, the application of a high voltage is possible. In the present study, the deposition behavior was no different from that for conventional EPD, being controllable by varying the applied voltage, deposition time, and particle concentration.

The compressive and flexural strength, water absorption by capillarity, drying capacity and susceptibility to cracking of these mortars were analyzed first. Then, based on these results, the most satisfactory replacement ratio was chosen and the following properties were analyzed: water retentivity, shrinkage, adhesive strength, modulus of elasticity, and water vapor permeability. Somewhat surprisingly the best results in the first stage occurred for 20% and 100% replacement ratios, leading to a cautious choice of the 20% ratio for the second stage.

The analysis of XPS, HRTEM, and Raman spectroscopy shows that the microstructure of deposited films turns from a TiC dominant TiC-C film to a carbon network dominant TiAl-doped a-C film structure as the CH4 flow increases from 30 sccm to 80 sccm. IR spectroscopy shows that most of the hydrogen atoms in the deposited films are bonded to the sp(3) -hybridized C atoms. All the composition and microstructure change can be explained by considering the plasma conditions and the effect of CH4 flow.","[Pang, Xianjuan] Henan Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Chem Engn & Pharmaceut, Luoyang 471023, Peoples R China; [Pang, Xianjuan; Liu, Xiaoqiang; Jin, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Lanzhou Inst Chem Phys, State Key Lab Solid Lubricat, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Pang, Xianjuan] Henan Key Lab Mat Tribol, Luoyang 471003, Peoples R China","Henan University of Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics, CAS","Pang, XJ (corresponding author), Henan Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Chem Engn & Pharmaceut, 263 Kaiyuan Rd, Luoyang 471023, Peoples R China.",xjpang2001@haust.edu.cn,,,Natural Science Foundation of China [50902133]; Project of the Education Department of Henan Province [14A430009]; Open Fund of State Key Laboratory of Solid Lubrication [1201]; Fund of Henan University of Science and Technology [2013QN001],Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Project of the Education Department of Henan Province; Open Fund of State Key Laboratory of Solid Lubrication; Fund of Henan University of Science and Technology,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 50902133), the Project of the Education Department of Henan Province (14A430009), the Open Fund of State Key Laboratory of Solid Lubrication (1201), and the Fund of Henan University of Science and Technology (2013QN001).",,20.0,4,4,0,45,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1687-4110,1687-4129,,J NANOMATER,J.

Furthermore, biomaterial interfaces can provide physical or chemical cues that are capable of stimulating cellular behaviors by regulating intracellular signaling cascades. Herein, a method of creating a biomimetic functional biointerface was introduced to enhance human neural stem cell (hNSC) adhesion. The hNSC-compatible biointerface was prepared by the oxidative polymerization of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, which generates a nanoscale organic thin layer, termed poly(norepinephrine) (pNE). Due to its adhesive property, pNE resulted in an adherent layer on various substrates, and pNE-coated biointerfaces provided a highly favorable microenvironment for hNSCs, with no observed cytotoxicity. Only a 2-hour incubation of hNSCs was required to firmly attach the stem cells, regardless of the type of substrate. Importantly, the adhesive properties of pNE interfaces led to micropatterns of cellular attachment, thereby demonstrating the ability of the interface to organize the stem cells. This highly facile surface-modification method using a biomimetic pNE thin layer can be applied to a number of suitable materials that were previously not compatible with hNSC technology.","[Park, Minah; Kim, Eunmi; Lee, Slgirim; Jang, Jae-Hyung] Yonsei Univ, Dept Biomol & Chem Engn, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [Shin, Mikyung; Lee, Haeshin] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Nanosci & Technol, Taejon 305701, South Korea; [Park, Kook In] Yonsei Univ, Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [Lee, Haeshin] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Nanosci & Technol, Dept Chem, Taejon 305701, South Korea",Yonsei University; Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST); Yonsei University; Yonsei University Health System; Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST),"Lee, H (corresponding author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Nanosci & Technol, Taejon 305701, South Korea.",haeshin@kaist.ac.kr; j-jang@yonsei.ac.kr,"Lee, Haeshin/C-1720-2011; Jang, Jae-Hyung/G-8030-2012; Shin, Mikyung/D-8483-2018","Shin, Mikyung/0000-0002-7990-5210; Kim, Eunmi/0000-0002-8576-2041","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant through the Active Polymer Center for Pattern Integration - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning (MSIP) [2007-0056091]; Basic Science Research Program - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning (MSIP) [2012R1A1A1003397]; Biomedical Technology Development Program - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning (MSIP) [2012-0006085]","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant through the Active Polymer Center for Pattern Integration - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning (MSIP); Basic Science Research Program - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning (MSIP); Biomedical Technology Development Program - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning (MSIP)","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant through the Active Polymer Center for Pattern Integration (no. 2007-0056091, Jae-Hyung Jang), Basic Science Research Program (2012R1A1A1003397, Jae-Hyung Jang), and Biomedical Technology Development Program (2012-0006085, Haeshin Lee) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning (MSIP).",,30.0,28,29,2,43,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1687-4110,1687-4129,,J NANOMATER,J.

In fluorescent microscopy experiments, whereby VACNFs are interfaced to cell and tissue cultures for a variety of applications, it was observed that this material is broadly fluorescent. In this paper, we provide insight into nature of these silicon/nitrogen in-situ coatings. We propose a potential mechanism for deposition of SiNx coating on the sidewalls of VACNFs during PECVD synthesis and explore the origin of the coating's fluorescence. It is most likely that the substrate reacts with process gases similar to reactive sputtering and chemical vapor deposition (CVD), forming silane and other silicon bearing compounds prior to isotropic deposition as a SiNx coating onto the VACNFs. The formation of Si-nanoclusters (NCs) is also implicated due to a combination of strong fluorescence and elemental analysis of the samples. These broadly luminescent fibers can prove useful as registry markers in fluorescent cellular studies and for tagging and tracing applications.","[Pearce, Ryan; Melechko, Anatoli] North Carolina State Univ, Mat Sci & Engn Dept, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [McKnight, Timothy] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Measurement Sci & Syst Engn Div, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Ivanov, Ilia N.; Hensley, Dale] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Ctr Nanophase Mat Sci, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Klein, Kate L.] Univ Dist Columbia, Washington, DC 20008 USA; [Meyer, Harry, III] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Mat Sci & Technol Div, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA",North Carolina State University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences; University of the District of Columbia; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory,"Melechko, A (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Mat Sci & Engn Dept, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",a.melechko@gmail.com,"Melechko, Anatoli/B-8820-2008; ivanov, ilia/D-3402-2015; McKnight, Timothy/H-3087-2011; Hensley, Dale/A-6282-2016","ivanov, ilia/0000-0002-6726-2502; Klein, Kate/0009-0008-8834-4081; McKnight, Timothy/0000-0003-4326-9117; Hensley, Dale/0000-0001-8763-7765","Scientific User Facilities Division, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, U.S. Department of Energy","Scientific User Facilities Division, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","A portion of research was conducted at the Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences, which is sponsored at Oak Ridge National Laboratory by the Scientific User Facilities Division, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, U.S. Department of Energy.",,34.0,0,1,0,0,AMER INST MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES-AIMS,SPRINGFIELD,"PO BOX 2604, SPRINGFIELD, MO 65801-2604 USA",2372-0468,2372-0484,,AIMS MATER SCI,AIMS Mater.

The PEG modified films were free of cracks and developed a porous structure after heat treatment at 500 degrees C, due to the thermal decomposition of the structure associated PEG. It was demonstrated that the photo-assisted electrochemical reduction of copper is promoted by the use of modified TiO2 films as photo-anodes, thanks to the greater surface area given by the PEG decomposition. However, the film thickness was found to be a critical factor in the process, to such an extent that films composed of 5 layers were completely inefficient, meaning that despite the open porosity, multilayered films acted as a barrier within the photo-electrolytic process.","[Ramirez-Santos, Alvaro A.; Acevedo-Pena, Prospero; Cordoba, Elcy M.] UIS, Grp Invest Minerales Biohidromet & Ambiente, Santander, Colombia",,"Ramírez-Santos, AA (corresponding author), UIS, Grp Invest Minerales Biohidromet & Ambiente, Calle 9 Cra 27,Postal Code 678, Santander, Colombia.",ecordoba@uis.edu.co,"Acevedo-Peña, Próspero/AFR-9868-2022","Ramirez Santos, Alvaro Andres/0000-0001-8355-8015; Cordoba Tuta, Elcy Maria/0000-0003-1199-8200","COLCIENCIAS [1102-521-28875]; UIS (DIEF Ingenierias Fisicoquimicas) [5430, 9416]","COLCIENCIAS(Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion Colciencias); UIS (DIEF Ingenierias Fisicoquimicas)","This work has been carried out with the financial support of COLCIENCIAS (Project 1102-521-28875) and UIS (DIEF Ingenierias Fisicoquimicas, Projects 5430 and 9416).",,46.0,6,6,1,23,"UNIV FED SAO CARLOS, DEPT ENGENHARIA MATERIALS",SAO CARLOS,"LABORATORIA DE MATERIAIS VITREOS, CAIXA POSTAL 676, SAO CARLOS, 13565-905SP, BRAZIL",1516-1439,1980-5373,,MATER RES-IBERO-AM J,Mater.

Having irregular shapes, the released particles are found to have unimodal size distributions with 1.5-3.5% (in mass) of Ti content. However, no free nanoparticles of TiO2 were found. Distinct phases during the particle number concentration evolution with time are also discussed and evaluated. Two quantities-(Delta C/Delta t)(1) and T-II-are identified as the important indicators to qualitatively measure the resistance strength and hence the concentration of the released particles from a nanocoating during stress application.","[Shandilya, Neeraj; Le Bihan, Olivier; Bressot, Christophe] Inst Natl Environm Ind & Risques INERIS, F-60550 Verneuil En Halatte, France; [Shandilya, Neeraj; Morgeneyer, Martin] Univ Technol Compiegne, F-60200 Compiegne, France",Institut National de l'Environnement Industriel et des Risques (INERIS); Universite de Technologie de Compiegne,"Shandilya, N (corresponding author), Inst Natl Environm Ind & Risques INERIS, Parc Technol Alata BP 2, F-60550 Verneuil En Halatte, France.",neeraj.shandilya@utc.fr,"Shandilya, Neeraj/AAX-3862-2020; Le Bihan, Olivier/L-2616-2016; Morgeneyer, Martin/R-1163-2018; Bressot, Christophe/Q-8769-2018","Le Bihan, Olivier/0000-0002-4775-960X; Morgeneyer, Martin/0000-0002-6763-7036; Bressot, Christophe/0000-0002-3649-0596; Shandilya, Neeraj/0000-0003-3328-8517","French Ministry of Environment (DRC 33 and Program 190); ANSES (Nanodata Project, APR ANSES); SERENADE","French Ministry of Environment (DRC 33 and Program 190); ANSES (Nanodata Project, APR ANSES); SERENADE","The authors would like to thank the French Ministry of Environment (DRC 33 and Program 190), ANSES (Nanodata Project, APR ANSES 2012), and SERENADE for financing the work and are equally grateful to O.

Microstructure of the as-deposited TiN/Ta multilayer film was observed by transmission electron microscopy and mechanical properties were investigated. Residual stress in the TiN/Ta multilayer film was about 72% of that of a TiN monolayer film with equivalent thickness deposited under the same conditions. Partial residual stress was released in the Ta sublayers during deposition, which led to the decrease of the residual stress of the TiN/Ta multilayer film. Nanohardness (H) of the TiN/Ta multilayer film was 24 GPa, 14% higher than that of the TiN monolayer film. It is suggested that the increase of the nanohardness is due to the introduction of the Ta layers which restrained the growth of TiN crystal and led to the decrease of the grain size. A significant increase (3.5 times) of the H-3/H-2 (E elastic modulus) value indicated that the TiN/Ta multilayer film has higher elasticity than the TiN monolayer film. The L-c (critical load innano-scratch test) value of the TiN monolayer film was 45 mN, which was far lower than that of the TiN/Ta multilayer film (around 75 mN). Results of the indentation test showed a higher fracture toughness of the TiN/Ta multilayer film than that of the TiN monolayer film. Results of differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) and thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) indicate that the TiN/Ta multilayer film has better thermal stability than the TiN monolayer film.","[Shang, Hongfei; Li, Jian] Wuhan Res Inst Mat Protect, Wuhan 430030, Peoples R China; [Shang, Hongfei; Shao, Tianmin] Tsinghua Univ, State Key Lab Tribol, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University,"Shao, TM (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, State Key Lab Tribol, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",shaotm@tsinghua.edu.cn,"Shang, Hongfei/AAC-7756-2019",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [51075308/E0505]; National Key Science and Technology Project [2010ZX04014-071],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Science and Technology Project,The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 51075308/E0505) and the National Key Science and Technology Project (Grant no. 2010ZX04014-071).,,31.0,7,7,2,45,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1687-8434,1687-8442,,ADV MATER SCI ENG,Adv.

The results suggest that the use of these ligands leads to the exclusive formation of metallic copper nanoparticles (Cu-NPs). The use of partially crosslinked polyallylamine (PAAmc) leads to nanoparticles (NPs) with low yields and high coating content, while linear PAAm leads to NPs with high yields and low coating content. The chemical composition of the particles was determined by XRD and average particle diameters were determined by the Debye-Scherrer equation. TGA analysis provided evidence of the content and thermal stability of the coating on the nanoparticles and PAAm. The morphology, particle size distribution, and presence of PAAm coating were observed through TEM. The use of AAm in the synthesis of NPs could be a good alternative to reduce costs. By using TGA, TEM, and DSC techniques, it was determined that synthesized NPs with AAm presented a coating with similar characteristics to NPs with PAAm, suggesting that AAm underwent polymerization during the synthesis.","[Sierra-Avila, Ruben; Perez-Alvarez, Marissa; Cadenas-Pliego, Gregorio; Alberto Avila-Orta, Carlos; Betancourt-Galindo, Rebeca; Jimenez-Regalado, Enrique; Martha Jimenez-Barrera, Rosa; Guillermo Martinez-Colunga, Juan] Ctr Invest Quim Aplicada, Saltillo 25294, Coahuila, Mexico",CIQA - Centro de Investigacion Quimica Aplicada,"Pérez-Alvarez, M (corresponding author), Ctr Invest Quim Aplicada, Saltillo 25294, Coahuila, Mexico.",marisa.perez@ciqa.edu.mx,"Avila-Orta, Carlos/HNR-9194-2023; Alvarez, Marissa/AAL-6125-2021; Cadenas-Pliego, Gregorio/Y-9188-2019","Sierra Avila, Ruben/0000-0002-7689-6283; Cadenas-Pliego, Gregorio/0000-0002-2692-4995; Jimenez, Rosa/0000-0002-0616-1433; MARTINEZ, JUAN GUILLERMO/0000-0003-2046-7743; Perez Alvarez, Marissa/0000-0002-1276-4230","CONACYT [127151/EU, 26396, 132578, 23415]; CuVito Project",CONACYT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); CuVito Project,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of CONACYT Grant 127151/EU 7th FP Grant 26396, CONACYT Grant 132578, and CuVito Project.

The inventions in the area of nanotechnologies and nanomaterials produce a profound effect in construction, housing and communal services and adjacent economic fields as they allow us: to obtain high strength and durability of surfaces of the details, to provide different materials with hydrophil properties, to increase efficiency of transformation of light energy into electrical one etc., and in general - to raise competitive ability of the products. For example, the method of production of solar element and a unit of solar elements (RU 2532137) comprises following stages: formation of pn-transfer in semiconductor base plate, formation of passivating layer on the light-receptive surface and/or non light-receptive surface of semiconductor base plate and formation of power robbing electrodes on the light-receptive surface and non light-receptive. A film of aluminium oxide is formed as passivating layer, its thickness is up to 40 nm, and electrode is formed by baking conductive paste under the temperature 500-900 degrees C for 1 second - 30 minutes with formation of sintered product. The sintered product penetrates through passivating layer setting electric contact between electrode and base plate. The formation of aluminium oxide with specified thickness on the surface of base plate makes it possible to achieve good passivating characteristics and good electric contact between silica and electrode only by means of baking conductive paste, that is standard technology. Moreover the baking stage which was necessary to get the effect of film passivation for aluminium oxide in the past now can be cancelled to decrease costs. The specialists may be also interested in the following nanotechnological inventions: reinforced flaked element made of natural or conglomerate stone and its multilayer protective coating (RU 2520193); fine organic suspension of carbon metal-containing nanostructures and the method to produce it (RU 2515858); the method of production of carbon nanomaterial (RU 2509053); the method to produce nanopowder of zinc oxide with the surface modification for the use in construction sealing materials (RU 2505379); building structures reinforcement composition (RU 2493337); nanostructured thermoelectric material (RU 2528338); conglutination composition for metal articles (RU 2526991); the method of nanosize structures formation (RU 2529458) etc.","[Vlasov, Vladimir Alexeevich] Int Acad Engn, Block 9,Bld 4, Moscow 125009, Russia",,"Vlasov, VA (corresponding author), Int Acad Engn, Block 9,Bld 4, Moscow 125009, Russia.",info@nanobuild.ru,"Vlasov, Vitaly/K-1257-2013",,,,,,6.0,7,7,0,0,NANOSTROITEL STVO,MOSCOW,"GAZETNYI PER-K, DOM 9, STR 4, MOSCOW, 125009, RUSSIA",2075-8545,,,NANOTECHNOL CONSTR,Nanotechnol.

Thickness and porosity of layers on glass were determined by analyzing the transmittance spectra in terms of thin layer optical models. Surface morphology was studied by scanning electron microscopy and it was found that silica coatings could not flatten out completely the surface of zinc. Corrosion tests were carried out in 0.2 g/L aqueous solution (pH=5) of Na2SO4. The electrochemical data (open-circuit potential, polarization resistance, corrosion potentials and the corrosion current densities) showed that all the coatings provided corrosion protection and it was found that two-layered coatings are more efficient that single ones.

The aim of the study is to reduce the flammability of textile materials using nanocomposite polymer back-coating. Different types of carbon nanotubes (single-and multiwalled) and different phosphorus flame retardants (ammonium polyphosphates and melamine polyphosphate) were introduced into the resin and then the fabrics were covered by the obtained composites. Homogeneous dispersion of multiwalled carbon nanotubes in the polyurethane resin was obtained by sonification, which was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. Flammability tests of fabrics coated by modified polyurethane resin were carried out using pyrolysis combustion flow calorimeter (PCFC) and thermal stability of textiles was evaluated. Also, organoleptic estimation of coatings was conducted (flexibility and fragility). The use of polymer nanocomposites with phophorus flame retardants as a back-coating for textiles effectively reduces flammability and improves thermal stability of the fabric. Furthermore, the synergistic effect beetwen carbon nanotubes and phosphorous compound occurs. The resulting coatings are flexible and do not crack or change the feel of fabrics.","[Wesolek, D.; Gieparda, W.] Inst Nat Fibres and Med Plants, PL-60630 Poznan, Poland",Institute of Natural Fibres & Medicinal Plants,"Gieparda, W (corresponding author), Inst Nat Fibres and Med Plants, Ulica Wojska Polskiego 71b, PL-60630 Poznan, Poland.",weronika.gieparda@iwnirz.pl,"Gieparda, Weronika/HKV-9088-2023",,European Union [POIG.01.03.01-00-004/08],European Union(European Union (EU)),"The study has been carried out within the Key Project-POIG.01.03.01-00-004/08 Functional nano- and microtextile materials-NANOMITEX cofinanced by the European Union with the financial resources of the European Regional Development Fund and the National Centre for Research and Development within the framework of the Innovative Economy Operational Programme, 2007-2013, Priority 1.

In this study, a soft lithography method was used to prepare epoxy coatings which showed surface microstructures in high replication to sandpapers. The effect of microstructures on coating's hydrophobicity and barrier property was investigated. Compared to flat coatings, the microstructured coatings showed much higher water contact angles, which further increased with finer sandpapers. Determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), the flat coating exhibited a higher anticorrosive performance than the microstructured coatings. With the use of finer sandpaper, the groove size of the corresponding microstructured coating was reduced. And a lower anticorrosive performance was observed since more defects might be formed in a given area of coating during the imprinting process. As the groove size of the coatings was further decreased to 5.7 mu m, the microstructures became too small for water to easily penetrate through. Therefore, trapped air acted as an additional barrier and contributed to an increased anticorrosive performance compared to other microstructured coatings.","[Zhang, Dawei; Li, Haiyang; Chen, Xiaoli; Qian, Hongchang; Li, Xiaogang] Univ Sci & Technol Beijing, Inst Adv Mat & Technol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",University of Science & Technology Beijing,"Zhang, DW (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol Beijing, Inst Adv Mat & Technol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",dzhang@ustb.edu.cn,"Zhang, Da-Wei/L-3344-2013; li, xiankun/HDP-1187-2022","Li, Xiaogang/0000-0001-9255-7559",National Natural Science Foundation of China [51401018]; National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) [2014CB643300]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [FRF-TP-14-044A1],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(National Basic Research Program of China); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 51401018), the National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program Project, no. 2014CB643300), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (no.

A previously reported purification process using an electromagnetic stirring with H2O2/HCl mixture was also repeated. Then, the purified carbon nanotubes were coated with copper by the same electroless plating process. At the end, the effects of the method on carbon nanotubes themselves and on copper coating were determined by transmission electron microscope spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope spectroscopy, X-ray diffractometry, thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy, and energy dispersive spectrometry. It was clearly confirmed that both of the two processes could remove most of iron catalyst particles and carbonaceous impurities without significant damage to carbon nanotubes. The thermal stability of the sample purified by H2O2/HCl treatment was slightly higher than that purified by HNO3-NaOH-HCl treatment. Nevertheless, the purification by HNO3-NaOH-HCl treatment was more effective for carboxyl functionalization on nanotubes than that by H2O2/HCl treatment. The Cu-coating on carbon nanotubes purified by both purification processes was complete, homogenous, and continuous.

Higher silicon content stabilized the amorphous structure while no effects of carbon were detected. Films with Nb start to crystallize at lower electron doses than the Zr-containing ones. During the crystallization, equiaxed MeC grains are formed in all samples with larger grains for ZrC (similar to 5 nm) compared to NbC (similar to 2 nm). The phenomenon of self-terminating crystallization at a dimension of 2-5 nm is explained by segregation of Si that is expelled from growing metal carbide grains into the surrounding amorphous phase matrix, which limits diffusion of the metal and carbon.","[Tengstrand, Olof; Lu, Jun; Flink, Axel; Eklund, Per; Hultman, Lars] Linkoping Univ, Dept Phys Chem & Biol IFM, Thin Film Phys Div, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden; [Nedfors, Nils; Andersson, Matilda; Jansson, Ulf] Uppsala Univ, Angstrom Lab, Dept Chem, S-75121 Uppsala, Sweden; [Flink, Axel] Impact Coatings AB, S-58216 Linkoping, Sweden",Linkoping University; Uppsala University,"Tengstrand, O (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, Dept Phys Chem & Biol IFM, Thin Film Phys Div, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden.",olote@ifm.liu.se; perek@ifm.liu.se,"Nedfors, Nils/KIE-4779-2024; Hultman, Lars/H-4061-2018; Lu, Jun/K-3321-2015; Eklund, Per/B-7677-2011","Eklund, Per/0000-0003-1785-0864",Swedish Agency for Innovation Systems (VINNOVA); Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research (SSF) through the Synergy Grant FUNCASE,Swedish Agency for Innovation Systems (VINNOVA)(Vinnova); Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research (SSF) through the Synergy Grant FUNCASE,"Work was performed within the VINNEX Center FunMat supported by The Swedish Agency for Innovation Systems (VINNOVA).

First, two single-layer coatings were obtained as reference coatings, using the micro- and the nanostructured feedstock, respectively. Four different composite coatings were then obtained by combining these two feedstocks. Two double-layer (multilayer) YSZ coatings were prepared by depositing the microstructured feedstock on the nanostructured layer and vice versa, while two coatings with different particle size gradients (graded coatings) were prepared by depositing various mixtures of the micro- and the nanostructured feedstock in alternate layers. The microstructure and hardness of the resulting coatings were determined. In the multilayer coatings, each layer exhibited a clearly different microstructure, whereas in the graded coatings the microstructural characteristics changed gradually. Coating hardness developed analogously, each layer displaying a marked change in hardness in the multilayer coatings in contrast to a gradual change in the graded coatings. The microstructure and hardness of the individual layers were thus quite well preserved in the developed composite coatings.","[Carpio, P.; Bannier, E.; Sanchez, E.] Univ Jaume I UJI, ITC, AICE, Castellon de La Plana, Spain; [Salvador, M.

Adaptive composites can thus be produced by embedding single crystalline particles or bamboo-structured Ni-Mn-Ga fibres into a polymer matrix. To guarantee a durable performance of these composites, adhesion between reinforcement phase and matrix should be quantified and optimised. The influence of annealing and surface treatment with an aminosilane of melt-spun Ni-Mn-Ga fibres on their strength and adhesion to an epoxy matrix was investigated using single fibre tension and fragmentation tests. Annealing of the melt-spun Ni-Mn-Ga fibres changed the surface from a pimpled to a smooth microstructure. This resulted in a reduced adhesion of the annealed fibres in comparison to the as-spun fibres embedded in an epoxy matrix. As-spun fibres exhibited an interfacial shear strength (IFSS) comparable to the shear strength of the epoxy matrix so that the silylation did not change the adhesion significantly. For the annealed fibres, the silane treatment improved the IFSS by 67%. Furthermore, the silylation increased the fracture strength of the Ni-Mn-Ga fibres due to surface flaw healing or forming of a protective surface coating. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The microstructural and tribological characteristics of Ni/nc-WC coating were investigated and compared with those of microcrystalline WC-12Co (mc-WC) and nanostructured WC-12Co (nc-WC) coatings. X-ray diffractometry, high-resolution field emission scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy were used to evaluate the microstructure of the powders and coatings. A ball-on-disk technique was used to probe the wear behavior of the coatings. The Ni/nc-WC coating showed negligible decarburization of similar to 5.4%, while mc-WC and nc-WC coatings suffered from higher decarburization levels of 16.3 and 36.8%. The wear rate of Ni/nc-WC coating was 2.5 x 10(-4) mg/m indicating similar to 75 and 82% increase in wear resistance compared with mc-WC and nc-WC coatings. The wear track analysis of mc-WC and nc-WC coatings showed evidences of delamination mechanism. Besides, a severe carbide pullout mechanism was operative in wear of nc-WC coating. As for Ni/nc-WC coating, individual carbide pullout following the elimination of Ni(Co) matrix was the predominant wear mechanism.","[Jafari, M.; Enayati, M. H.; Salehi, M.; Hosseini, S.

The present research has been conducted in order to study the sliding wear response of a SPS ZrO2-8% mol. Y2O3 coating (75 mu m in thickness) deposited onto a Haynes 230 substrate, using pin-on-disc tests. Some of the coated samples were subsequently heat-treated for 1 h at 300 and 600 A degrees C. Samples characterization prior and after the wear tests was carried out by SEM, EDS, XRD and optical profilometry techniques. Instrumented indentation was employed to determine elastic modulus and hardness. The results have shown that the as-sprayed and heat-treated samples experienced severe wear (10(-13) m(3)/Nm) and the worst wear performance corresponded to the sample heat treated at 600 A degrees C. Such a behavior could be related to both the structural changes that took place during heat treatment and the nature and level of the residual stresses in the coatings. In general, the morphologies of the wear tracks observed by SEM have shown a smoothing of the surface, brittle fracture, smearing and grain pull-out.","[Kossman, S.; Puchi-Cabrera, E. S.; Santana, Y.

Thin films of TiN, CrN, and Ti/TiN multilayer, having thickness of 300 nm, are deposited on Zr60Ni10Cu20Al10 and Zr50Cu40Al10 metallic glasses by RF sputtering technique. Strain softening occurs over several cycles in Zr-based metallic glasses, CrN, and TiN films as evidenced by a disparity between the unloading and reloading sequences. However, the cyclic nanoindentation of Ti/TiN multilayer coating results in a hysteresis loop in the load-depth profiles, and this event depends on the number of cycles and the loading rates. AFM and SEM characterization of remnant imprints revealed microcraks and crack-like shear bands in nanocoatings and Zr-based metallic glasses, respectively. Based on shear-fracture driven plastic flow of the coatings, a modified cavity model is used to determine the shear stress evolution as a function of penetration depth.

The photocatalytic coating was homogeneous and preserved the composition and nanostructure of the starting powder. The inner titanium sub-oxide coating favored the deposition of anatase particles in the solid state. Agglomerated nano-TiO2 particles fragmented when impacting onto the hard surface of the APS TiO2-x bond coat. The rough surface provided by APS provided an ideal scenario for entrapping the nanostructured particles, which may be adhered onto the bond coat due to chemical bonding; a possible bonding mechanism is described. Photocatalytic experiments showed that CGS nano-TiO2 coating was active for photodegrading phenol and formic acid under aqueous conditions. The results were similar to the performance obtained by competitor technologies and materials such as dip-coating P25(A (R)) photocatalysts. Disparity in the final performance of the photoactive materials may have been caused by differences in grain size and the crystalline composition of titanium dioxide.","[Gardon, M.; Dosta, S.; Cano, I.

The deposited coating was subjected to heat treatment to improve the microstructure characteristics and its corresponding high-temperature properties. The isothermal high-temperature corrosion behavior at 650 and 700 A degrees C in synthetic air and in the presence of 1% Cl-2 was investigated using thermogravimetric analysis, x-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. The results indicated that the deposited NiCrAlY coating possessed acceptable oxidation-corrosion resistance at 650 A degrees C owing to the formation of extensive amounts of the protective oxide of Cr2O3; NiO and a lesser amount of a Cr-1.12 Ni-2,Ni-88 metallic phase are also formed. At 700 A degrees C, the coating lost its protective characteristic because of the excessive consumption of thermodynamically stable phases by oxidation-chlorination process. In this case, the steel base and the coating were attacked by chlorine during the exposure time; the mass gain of the NiCrAlY coating was slightly higher and provided only a limited protection up to 11 h; thereafter, breakdown of the layer of oxides occurred and this is attributed to the formation of non-protective oxides mainly beta-Fe2O3 and Fe21.33O32 and the depletion of chromium.","[Habib, K.

The exact location where the particle heating is initiated (above the carrier liquid boiling point) can be controlled by increasing the water content in the mixture. In this way, the particle inflight time in the high-temperature gas regions can be adjusted avoiding adverse effects from surface chemical transformations. The mixture is modeled as a multicomponent droplet, and a convection/diffusion model, which takes into account the convective flow of evaporating material from droplet surface, is used to simulate the suspension evaporation. The model consists of several sub-models that include premixed combustion of propane-oxygen, non-premixed ethanol-oxygen combustion, modeling of multicomponent droplet breakup and evaporation, as well as heat and mass transfer between liquid droplets and gas phase.","[Gozali, Ebrahim; Kamnis, Spyros] Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Suzhou, Peoples R China; [Mahrukh, Mahrukh; Gu, Sai] Cranfield Univ, Bedford, England",Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University; Cranfield University,"Kamnis, S (corresponding author), Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Suzhou, Peoples R China.",spyros.kamnis@xjtlu.edu.cn,"Kamnis, Spyros/HRA-4209-2023; Mahrukh, Mahrukh/U-1032-2017","Kamnis, Spyros/0000-0001-6433-3101; Mahrukh, Mahrukh/0000-0003-1280-4340; Gozali, Ebrahim/0000-0003-1548-7002",School of Engineering in Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University; UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/K027530/1]; EPSRC [EP/K027530/1] Funding Source: UKRI,School of Engineering in Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University; UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),The authors would like to acknowledge financial support for the research studentship from the School of Engineering in Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University and the financial support by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) Project Grant: EP/K027530/1.,,28.0,16,16,0,33,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1059-9630,1544-1016,,J THERM SPRAY TECHN,J.

The morphological, structural, and thermal properties of the Ag/N6 nanocomposite membranes were analyzed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). FESEM imaging showed that the Ag coating on individual N6 nanofibers was continuous, uniform, and compact. A DSC study of the nanocomposites illustrated a strong interfacial adhesion of the Ag layer with N6 nanofiber surfaces via strong hydrogen bonds. A possible mechanism for hydrogen bond formation during the hydrothermal process was proposed. Further, it was found that the transition of the meta-stable gamma-form into the thermodynamically more stable alpha-form of N6 structure was achieved; therefore, the hydrothermal process did not cause chain degradation.","[Abdal-hay, Abdalla] Chonbuk Natl Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Bionano Syst Engn, Jeonju 561756, South Korea; [Abdal-hay, Abdalla] Univ Cuenca, Dept Comp Sci, Fac Engn, Cuenca 0101168, Ecuador; [Abdal-hay, Abdalla] South Valley Univ, Dept Engn Mat & Mech Design, Fac Engn, Qena, Egypt; [Khalil, Khalil Abdelrazek] King Saud Univ, Dept Mech Engn, CEREM Coll Engn, Riyadh 11421, Saudi Arabia; [Lim, Juhyun] Univ Ulsan, Gangneung Asan Hosp, Dept Urol, Coll Med, Kangnung, South Korea; [Lim, Jae Kyoo] Chonbuk Natl Univ, Dept Mech Design Engn, Adv Wind Power Syst Res Inst, Jeonju 561756, South Korea",Jeonbuk National University; Universidad de Cuenca; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); South Valley University Egypt; King Saud University; University of Ulsan; Jeonbuk National University,"Abdal-hay, A (corresponding author), Chonbuk Natl Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Bionano Syst Engn, Jeonju 561756, South Korea.",abdalla.ali@ucuenca.edu.ec; jklim@jbnu.ac.kr,"Abdelmawgoud, Khalil/C-2656-2012; Abdal-hay, Abdalla/AAA-2796-2022",/0000-0001-6307-6027,"National Secretary of Higher Education, Science, Technology and Innovation of Ecuador, SENESCYT; Prometeo Grant Fellow Project at University of Cuenca","National Secretary of Higher Education, Science, Technology and Innovation of Ecuador, SENESCYT; Prometeo Grant Fellow Project at University of Cuenca","We acknowledge the research funds supported by the National Secretary of Higher Education, Science, Technology and Innovation of Ecuador, SENESCYT (known as Prometeo Project Scholarship Viejos Sabios-2014 year).

Increasing pressure resistance of superhydrophobic coatings is of interest for practical use because high external pressures may be exerted on surfaces during operation. The Cassie state stability against the external pressure of coatings was investigated by squeezing droplets sitting on surfaces with a hydrophobic plate. Droplets on the single-layer coating transformed to the Wenzel state and pinned to the surface after squeezing, whereas droplets on the double-layer micro/nanoporous coating preserved the Cassie state and rolled off the surface easily. In addition, the contact angle and contact-line diameter of water droplets during evaporation from surfaces were in situ investigated to further understand the stability of coatings against Wenzel transition. A droplet on a microporous coating gradually transformed to the Wenzel state and lost its spherical shape as the droplet volume decreased (i.e., the internal pressure of the droplet increased). The contact line of the droplet during evaporation remained almost unchanged. In contrast, a water droplet on a double-layer surface preserved its spherical shape even at the last stages of the evaporation process, where pressure differences as high as a few thousand pascals were generated. For this case, the droplet contact line retracted during evaporation and the droplet recovered the initial water contact angle. The demonstrated method for the preparation of robust transparent superhydrophobic coatings is promising for outdoor applications such as self-cleaning cover glasses for solar cells and nonwetting windows.","[Tuvshindorj, Urandelger; Yildirim, Adem; Ozturk, Fahri Emre; Bayindir, Mehmet] Bilkent Univ, UNAM Natl Nanotechnol Res Ctr, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey; [Tuvshindorj, Urandelger; Yildirim, Adem; Ozturk, Fahri Emre; Bayindir, Mehmet] Bilkent Univ, Inst Mat Sci & Nanotechnol, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey; [Bayindir, Mehmet] Bilkent Univ, Dept Phys, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey",Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University; Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University; Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University,"Bayindir, M (corresponding author), Bilkent Univ, UNAM Natl Nanotechnol Res Ctr, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.",bayindir@nano.org.tr,"Yildirim, Adem/A-1187-2015","Tuvshindorj, Urandelger/0000-0002-9544-9040; Ozturk, Fahri Emre/0000-0002-8705-6861; YILDIRIM, ADEM/0000-0001-6787-0148; Bayindir, Mehmet/0000-0003-0233-6870",TUBITAK-BiDEB; TUBITAK [111T696]; Turkish Academy of Sciences,TUBITAK-BiDEB(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)); TUBITAK(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)); Turkish Academy of Sciences(Turkish Academy of Sciences),U.T. and A.Y. are supportd by TUBITAK-BiDEB graduate student fellowship.

Concerns have been expressed that journalists reporting on health are increasingly dependent on their sources-including representatives of industries responsible for manufacturing health-related products-for story ideas and content. Many critics perceive an imbalance of power between journalists and industry sources, with industry being in a position of relative power, however the empirical evidence to support this view is limited. The analysis presented here-which is part of a larger study of industry-journalist relationships-draws on in-depth, semi-structured interviews with representatives of health-related industries in Australia to inductively examine their perceptions of power relations between industry and journalists. Participants painted a picture in which journalists, rather than themselves, were in a position to control the nature, extent, and outcome of their interactions with industry sources. Our results resonate with the concept of mediatisation as it has been applied in the domain of political reporting.

Consequently, a combination of hydroxyapatite with TiO2 sprayed by high velocity oxy-fuel spray was considered in this study. As infection after joint replacement surgery is one of the most critical concerns when considering implant performance, it is necessary to study possible ways to reduce or eliminate it. Two coating treatments were chosen for this study: addition of a percentage of ZnO and immersion in gentamicin for 24 h. Furthermore, three bacteria were considered: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. The evolution of bacteria viability in solution was measured at 0, 2, and 4 h; and plate assays were performed to study antibacterial effects by diffusion. The results show an important antibacterial effect of the as-sprayed coating, attributed to the presence of -OH radicals on the surface. The presence of ZnO did not have any additional influence on bacteria viability, but gentamicin-treated samples showed an improvement in antibacterial behavior for Gram-negative bacteria in solution, as well as a bactericidal effect in diffusion conditions.","[Melero, H.; Fernandez, J.; Guilemany, J.

Here, we compare two functionalisation procedures (chemical vapour deposition and wet impregnation) on substrate films composed by preformed oxide particles. Three kinds of particles, characterised by different natures (SiO2 and TiO2) and average particle size, were studied to highlight possible effects related to the chemical and morphological state of the substrate surface. Morphological characterisations were carried out using dynamic light scattering and scanning electron microscopy, while the structure of the hydrophobing layer was studied by combining Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance. The degree of functionalisation and the features of the siloxane layer vary significantly among the adopted oxides and functionalisation methods. The wettability features of the different hybrids closely mirror the results of the spectroscopic characterisations, giving rise to either Lotus leaf or patch-wise hydrophobic systems depending on the adopted conditions.","[Soliveri, Guido; Meroni, Daniela; Cappelletti, Giuseppe; Annunziata, Rita; Ardizzone, Silvia] Univ Milan, Dept Chem, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Soliveri, Guido; Meroni, Daniela; Cappelletti, Giuseppe; Ardizzone, Silvia] Consorzio Interuniv Nazl Sci & Tecnol Mat INSTM, I-50121 Florence, Italy; [Aina, Valentina; Cerrato, Giuseppina] Univ Turin, Dept Chem, IFM & NIS Interdept, Excellence Ctr, I-10125 Turin, Italy",University of Milan; University of Turin,"Meroni, D (corresponding author), Univ Milan, Dept Chem, Via Golgi 19, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",daniela.meroni@unimi.it,"Cerrato, Giuseppina/AAG-8779-2021; Cappelletti, Giuseppe/R-6329-2016; ARDIZZONE, SILVIA/N-1129-2016; Annunziata, Rita/N-2862-2016; Soliveri, Guido/O-7763-2014","MERONI, DANIELA/0000-0002-3386-9293; Cerrato, Giuseppina/0000-0001-8536-1398; Cappelletti, Giuseppe/0000-0002-1260-2979; ARDIZZONE, SILVIA/0000-0001-8360-3699; Annunziata, Rita/0000-0001-5402-1841; Soliveri, Guido/0000-0002-3299-1975",University of Milan Research Funds (PUR),University of Milan Research Funds (PUR),This research has been supported by the University of Milan Research Funds (PUR).,,36.0,17,18,0,82,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0022-2461,1573-4803,,J MATER SCI,J.

Preparation methods studied were dip-coating using polytetrafluoroethylene as binder on cellular metal structures, a chemical vapor deposition coating of the metal structures with thin carbide layers and subsequent conversion to carbide-derived carbon, and the partial or full conversion of carbide foams to carbon/carbide composites. For the binder method, optimal parameters for stable slurry preparation as well as for calcination of the slurry were obtained.

It is also evident that the silane films protect the zinc surface through the formation of an isolating barrier. Through voltamperometric studies it was possible to define an electrochemical porosity of the protective coatings.

The mechanical performance of rovings and single fibres of well-defined silane-and water-sized E-glass fibre samples was investigated at room temperature after thermal conditioning at temperatures up to 400 degrees C. Thermal conditioning for 15 min led to strength degradation of >50 % at higher temperatures. The tensile strength of silane-coated fibres was relatively stable up to 300 degrees C but exhibited a precipitous drop at higher conditioning temperatures. The water-sized fibres exhibited an approximately linear decrease in strength with increasing conditioning temperature. The strength distribution of the water-sized fibres could be well represented by a unimodal three-parameter Weibull distribution. The strength distributions of the sized fibres were more complicated and required the use of a bimodal Weibull distribution. The results are discussed in terms of the changes in surface coating and bulk glass structure during heat conditioning.,"[Thomason, J. L.; Kao, C.

In general, organic additives are added to the deposition bath in order to improve deposition characteristics such as corrosion resistance, hardness and deposition efficiency. Despite of the literature present information about the various organic additives effects on Zn coating properties there is no analysis of organic compounds with free electron-containing radicals, such as formic acid and cyclohexylamine. The formic acid has oxygen atoms with free electrons, whereas cyclohexylamine contains nitrogen with free electrons. Aiming at overcoming this gap, this manuscript presents an analysis of the effect in addition of formic acid mixture and cyclohexylamine on the deposition flow efficiency, corrosion resistance, hardness, roughness and micro-structure of Zn coating on carbon steel AISI 1020. The corrosion resistance evaluation was performed by potentiodynamic polarization determined by polarization resistance and weight loss tests as well. The analisys of morphology and electrodeposited microstructures were made by the Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Spectrometry X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). The Zn coatings were obtained from chloride deposition baths at constant pH 5. Results showed that corrosion resistance in the 0.5 mol/L NaCl solution of Zn coatings increases with the addition of the mixture of the formic acid and / or cyclohexylamine. Also, the corrosion resistance is higher with mixture than with additives alone. The addition of the mixture formic acid and cyclohexylamine increases the basal plane presence (0 0 2). However, the basal plane presence (0 0 2) does not increase when formic acid and cyclohexylamine are added alone which indicates a synergic effect of formic acid and cyclohexylamine in in the plan promotion (0 0 2). Also, was observed that an addition of formic acid mixture and cyclohexylamine increases the current deposition efficiency, decreases the roughness and raises the Zn coating hardness.","[Lopes, Carolina da Silva; de Santana, Paulo Moura; Fanezi Rocha, Claudia Liziane; Caldas de Souza, Carlos Alberto] Univ Fed Bahia, Labs Met & Corrosao, Escola Politecn, Salvador, BA, Brazil",Universidade Federal da Bahia,"Lopes, CD (corresponding author), Univ Fed Bahia, Labs Met & Corrosao, Escola Politecn, Salvador, BA, Brazil.",carolinalops@gmail.com,,"Caldas de Sousa, Carlos Alberto/0000-0001-5262-3734",,,,,21.0,3,3,1,12,"UNIV FED SAO CARLOS, DEPT ENGENHARIA MATERIALS",SAO CARLOS,"LABORATORIA DE MATERIAIS VITREOS, CAIXA POSTAL 676, SAO CARLOS, 13565-905SP, BRAZIL",1516-1439,1980-5373,,MATER RES-IBERO-AM J,Mater.

The longest protection is provided by a film formed in 10 minutes of degreasing in an alkaline phosphate solution, which is associated with incorporation of the inorganic inhibitor into the coating. Treatment of Mg90 samples coated with different oxide-hydroxide films in aqueous solutions of the CI improves the corrosion resistance. The protection efficiency was estimated in three ways: based on anodic polarization curves recorded in a borate buffer (pH 9.2) containing 1.0 mM NaCl; from EIS results obtained in the same solution but at the free corrosion potential, and by accelerated corrosion tests at 100% relative air humidity with forced daily moisture condensation on the samples. According to the EIS data, the formulation of 12 mM SOl + 4 mM vinyltrimethoxysilane (VS) was the best mixed CI, in whose solution a one-hour exposure of Mg90 samples chemically preoxidized in 5 M NaOH provided a high degree of protection, Z=99.89%. The mixture of 12 mM IFKhAN 25F + 4 mM VS was slightly less efficient (Z= 99.83), but it proved to be the best CI in accelerated corrosion tests. FTIR analysis of the Mg90 surface confirmed the presence of CI components on it, and in the case of 12 mM IFKhAN 25F + 4 mM VS, a band corresponding to the stretching vibrations of the Si-O-Si bonds was found in the range of 1000-1100 cm(-1), indicating the formation of a network of siloxane bonds. This fact, together with the existence a band with a maximum at 3280 cm(-1) due to the stretching vibrations of the silanol groups, supports our earlier assumption that an increase in the passivation efficiency upon incorporation of VS into the mixture is due to the ability of such a network to prevent the desorption of the main CI.","[Luchkina, V.

The mixture was prepared by varying the molar ratio of SnO2 to TiO2, i.e. TiO2:SnO2 (9:1), TiO2:SnO2 (8:2) and TiO2:SnO2 (6:4)). The obtained samples were characterized by means of the Raman microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), UV-Vis spectrophotometry and m-lines spectroscopy (Prism coupler). Raman analysis shows that pure TiO2 and SnO2 thin films are characterized by the vibrational modes of anatase and rutile cassiterite, respectively. Furthermore, the Raman spectra of the TiO2:SnO2 nanocomposites show the presence of a mixture of anatase and rutile TiO2 phases. The SEM images reveal that the morphology is clearly modified with SnO2 content. The ripples in the transmittance spectra decreased with increasing SnO2 content. Also, the evolution of the optical band gap seems to be consistent with the Raman analysis. A great attention has been paid to the refractive index measurements by the prism coupler technique. In this way, variable-refractive index systems have been successfully obtained using TiO2:SnO2 nanocomposite thin films.","[Medjaldi, F.; Bouabellou, A.; Taabouche, A.; Bouatia, K.; Serrar, H.] Univ Freres Mentouri Constantine 1, Thin Films & Interfaces Lab, Constantine, Algeria; [Bouachiba, Y.] Natl Polytech Sch Constantine, Dept Mat Sci Engn, Nouvelle Ville Ali Mendj, Algeria; [Taabouche, A.] Univ Kasdi Merbah, Fac Hydrocarbons Renewable Energies & Earth & Uni, Ouargla, Algeria; [Serrar, H.] Res Ctr Ind Technol CRTI, BP 64, Cheraga, Alger, Algeria",Universite Kasdi Merbah Ouargla,"Medjaldi, F (corresponding author), Univ Freres Mentouri Constantine 1, Thin Films & Interfaces Lab, Constantine, Algeria.",medjaldifarida@yahoo.com,"TAABOUCHE, Adel/AAE-5215-2022","TAABOUCHE, Adel/0000-0001-6059-4240; Serrar, Hacene/0000-0002-3609-2328",,,,,33.0,29,29,3,51,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",,2053-1591,,MATER RES EXPRESS,Mater.

The tests were made on uncoated and coated materials using a polyester resin (Gelcoat), which is used to protect the leading edge of wind turbine blades against the weather and UV rays and is of interest, in this study, to know the behaviour of this coating subjected to hard particles erosion. The tests were performed at 50 degrees C, in order to simulate de extreme temperature in the coast of Oaxaca, Mexico, where some wind turbines are installed using blades made of fiberglass coated with gelcoat. Erosion tests were performed in a platform that was developed from the ASTM G76 standard. The rectangular samples had 25 x 18 mm and thickness of 4 mm. Sea sand from coast of Oaxaca was utilized as erosive particle. Three different impact angles were used 75 degrees, 85 degrees and 90 degrees. The particle velocity was adjusted at 12 m s(-1). To determine the mass loss, the samples were weighed before the test and reweighed every 2 min to measure the amount of mass loss until complete the 6 min of the test. In order to identify the wear mechanisms, Scanning Electron Microscopy was used. The average roughness (Ra) and profiles of the samples tested were determined with a 3D optical profilometer. The results showed that Carbon fiber composite material had 3 times more resistance to erosive wear than fiberglass.","[Mendoza, J. C. Mendoza; Cardenas, E. E.

The aim of the study is to determine the effect of the source composition on the physical properties of the finished coating. Thermal stability was determined by periodic heating in a thermal chamber to a temperature of 800 degrees C for 5 h and then cooled in water. Corrosion resistance was determined by the change in roughness. Profiles and profilometers were used to determine the roughness parameters. Fire resistance was determined by the time from the start of the test to the onset of one of the normalized boundary states. It is set, that to improve the heat resistance of steel structures it is expedient to use appropriate coatings based on full aluminosiloxane polymer which contain Al2O3, ZrO2, kaolin, kaolin fiber and modifier TiO2 as fillers. The heat resistance of protective coatings for steel decreases by 20%-30% when kaolin is added at a heating temperature higher than 753 K. The heat resistance is increased by 30%-40% when kaolin fiber is added. Depth of corrosion of materials with developed protective coatings decreases by 2.2-3.5 times. The results of the study confirm that the introduction of kaolin in the coatings increases the fire resistance of the studied materials. Thus, the performance properties of the protective coatings can be adjusted over a wide temperature range by changing the oxide and silicate fillers.","[Peredriy, Oksana; Pakholiuk, Olena; Khvyshchun, Nadiia] Lutsk Natl Tech Univ, Lutsk, Ukraine; [Martirosyan, Irina] Odessa Natl Acad Food Technol, Odessa, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Lutsk National Technical University; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Odesa National University of Technology,"Peredriy, O (corresponding author), Lutsk Natl Tech Univ, Lutsk, Ukraine.",romanenko735@ukr.net,"Peredriy, Oksana/ABD-5781-2020; Martirosan, Irina/P-2931-2015; Peredriy, Oksana/U-8378-2017; Pakholiuk, Olena/AED-5601-2022","Martirosan, Irina/0000-0003-3733-3004; Peredriy, Oksana/0000-0002-5464-2020; Pakholiuk, Olena/0000-0002-3484-0468",,,,,13.0,1,1,0,5,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",,2053-1591,,MATER RES EXPRESS,Mater.

The pressure induces enhanced phase stability while keeping the interfaces between coatings and the substrates intact. Hardness measurements of the as-deposited coatings and after high-pressure high-temperature treatment show that the hardness after treatment of Ti0.63Al0.37N at 5.35 GPa, 1300 degrees C and after 66 min drops from 29.6 to 27.8 GPa, because after this treatment this sample contains cubic TiN and hexagonal AlN. This drop is much smaller than if the coatings are just heat treated at 1300 degrees C and suggests that an enhancement of TiAlN-coatings on cubic BN cuttings tools can be achieved by increasing the pressure/stress during cutting. For Ti0.37Al0.63N treated at 5.35 GPa, 1300 degrees C and after 66 min the hardness drops from 36.1 to 28.6 GPa, which means that the coating has first decomposed through spinodal decomposition and one of products of this decomposition has further phase transformed and the final products are cubic TiN and hexagonal AlN.","[Pilemalm, Robert] Linkoping Univ, Dept Phys Chem & Biol IFM, Thin Film Phys Div, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden; [Sjogren, Anna] Element Six AB, SE-91532 Robertsfors, Sweden",Linkoping University,"Pilemalm, R (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, Dept Phys Chem & Biol IFM, Thin Film Phys Div, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden.",robert.pilemalm@gmail.com,"Pilemalm, Robert/E-4065-2019",,Swedish Knowledge Foundation (KK-stiftelsen); VINNEX Center of Excellence for Functional Nanoscale Materials (FunMat),Swedish Knowledge Foundation (KK-stiftelsen); VINNEX Center of Excellence for Functional Nanoscale Materials (FunMat),"This work was funded by the Swedish Knowledge Foundation (KK-stiftelsen) and by the VINNEX Center of Excellence for Functional Nanoscale Materials (FunMat).

Combining nanoparticles with conventional microscale powders are increasingly being investigated to use with feedstock materials for thermal spray processes. Accordingly, this work investigates the addition of nano-Al2O3 particles on the microstructure and erosion wear of NiCrSiB HVOF coating in a stainless steel (AISI 304) substrate. Particle analysis of the NiCrSiB feedstock was conducted and the maximum allowable addition of Al2O3 nanoparticles have been identified using the 'mass mixture ratio' model considering both the particle size and density. Consequently, two cases are considered and their performance analysed: a maximum allowable case of 1.4 wt%, followed by a 0.17 wt% addition of nano-Al2O3 with NiCrSiB. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) and x-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis were employed to inform the microstructure, material composition and phase spectrum of the resulting coatings. Subsequently, the nanostructured coating was exposed to both a pull-off adhesion strength test and hot air jet (450 degrees C) hard particle erosion to characterise its performance. It was found that the microhardness of the HVOF NiCrSiB coating improved from 576 HV(0.3 )to 748 HV0.3 with the addition of 1.4 wt% nano-Al2O3. Furthermore, the nanostructured coating also exhibited high erosion resistance at a 90 degrees erodent impact angle. The increase in erosion wear resistance was due to the increase in the hardness as a result of the nano-Al(2)O(3 )addition.","[Praveen, Ayyappan Susila] Vel Tech Rangaraj Dr Sagunthala R&D Inst Sci & Te, Dept Mech Engn, Morai, Tamil Nadu, India; [Arjunan, Arun] Univ Wolverhampton, Sch Engn, Telford Innovat Campus, Telford TF2 9NT, Shrops, England",Vel Tech Rangarajan Dr Sagunthala R&D Institute of Science & Technology; University of Wolverhampton,"Arjunan, A (corresponding author), Univ Wolverhampton, Sch Engn, Telford Innovat Campus, Telford TF2 9NT, Shrops, England.",a.arjunan@wlv.ac.uk,"Ayyappan Susila, Praveen/ABA-5083-2021; Arjunan, Arun/H-9612-2019","Arjunan, Arun/0000-0001-5493-0957; A S, PRAVEEN/0000-0001-5877-3805",,,,,79.0,30,30,0,14,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",,2053-1591,,MATER RES EXPRESS,Mater.

The best ways to upgrade their wear resistance are to introduce hard particle reinforcement to produce a metal matrix composite which can be used as a coating. In the present study Ti-6Al-4V-4B(4)C metal matrix composite coatings were coated on AISI 1040 steel using the magnetron sputtering process and their dry sliding wear behavior was studied at room temperature. The coating morphology was explored by SEM, XRD, FT-IR, and AFM. The constant coating thicknesses of 80 nm and 115 nm were achieved for 0.5 h and 1 h coating duration, respectively. The effects of introducing B4C on the hardness, thermal behavior, wear, and friction characteristics were studied. The nano hardness and elastic modulus were attained by AFM nanoindentation technique which showed a maximum of 21.7 GPa and 218.4 GPa, respectively. It was proven that the adding of B4C increases the thermal stability of Ti-6Al-4V-4B(4)C coatings as well as modifies the oxidation mechanism. It is expected that the addition of B4C will improve the thermal behavior of thin film coatings for their practical application. Wear tests were executed by ball-on-disc wear tester with E-52100 sphere as the counterface at a sliding velocity of 2 m s(-1) with 3 N load. Wear rate and coefficient of friction (CoF) reduced with an increase in load and sliding distances also composite coatings exhibited higher wear resistance within entire loading conditions, hereafter suggesting that it could be a favorable substitute to other hard coatings.","[Prince, R.

The Au/ZnPc interfaces appears to be strongly affected by the large lattice mismatches at the interface. It is observed that the coating ZnPc onto Au substrates increases the light absorbability by 4.7 and 128.2 times in the visible and infrared regions of light, respectively. Au substrates activated the free carrier absorption mechanism in the ZnPc thin films in the infrared range of light. In addition, the transparent Au substrates forced narrowing the energy band gap in both of the Q and B bands. It also increased the dielectric constant value by similar to 3.5 times in the IR range. The enhancements in the optical properties of ZnPc that resulted from the thin Au substrates make the ZnPc more suitable for optoelectronic, nonlinear optical applications and for electromagnetic energy storage in the infrared range of light.","[Qasrawi, A.

Niobium could be added to these alloys to improve their resistance to wear. This study consisted in addressing the influence of 0.5% and 1.0% of niobium on the microstructure of a 26% Cr and 2.8% C HCCI alloy. Standard samples - without niobium - and samples with 0.5% and 1.0% Nb were melted, cut and then machined into adequate dimensions for tests. Two groups of samples - with and without heat treatment - were analyzed through X-ray Diffraction (XRD), optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Vickers and Rockwell-C hardness. Carbides Volume Fraction (CVF) was quantified in the heat-treated samples. The majority of NbC carbides were observed to be thin and presented a hook shaped morphology. In addition, it was noted a precipitation of Nb-rich layers around the M7C3 carbides, which could act as a higher hardness coating. There was significant reduction in carbide volume fraction, from an initial 33.3% to 28.1% for the 0.5 % Nb alloy, and further reduction to 24.9% for the 1.0% Nb alloy, it was also noted an alteration on the quasi-eutectic microstructure to a hypoeutectic microstructure. The NbC carbides prevented hardness reduction as a result of lowering the CVF in heat-treated alloys; however, the alloys without heat treatment experienced reductions in hardness.","[Rabelo de Melo, Ismael Nogueira] Fed Inst Minas Gerais, Ibirite, MG, Brazil; [da Silva, Anderson Edson; da Silva, Leonardo Roberto; Pinheiro, Ivete Peixoto] Fed Ctr Technol Educ Minas Gerais, Mat Engn Dept, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil","Instituto Federal de Educacao, Ciencia e Tecnologia de Minas Gerais (IFMG)","de Melo, INR (corresponding author), Fed Inst Minas Gerais, Ibirite, MG, Brazil.",ismaelnrmelo@gmail.com; anderson_edson@hotmail.com; leonardo.robertosilva@hotmail.com; ivetepinhei-ro@cefetmg.br,"Melo, Ismael/AAT-3794-2021; Silva, Anderson/AAW-5737-2021","Melo, Ismael Nogueira Rabelo de/0000-0003-3125-3687; Silva, Leonardo/0000-0001-6043-7931; silva, anderson/0000-0001-9982-0110","FINEP [01.09.0397.00 -CTINFRA 2008, 01.10.0794.00 CTINFRA 2009]; FAPEMIG; Federal Center of Technological Education of Minas Gerais",FINEP(Financiadora de Inovacao e Pesquisa (Finep)); FAPEMIG(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)); Federal Center of Technological Education of Minas Gerais,"Thanks FINEP for the financing of equipment (01.09.0397.00 -CTINFRA 2008, 01.10.0794.00 CTINFRA 2009), FAPEMIG and the Federal Center of Technological Education of Minas Gerais for the master's degree scholarship.",,22.0,0,0,0,5,"UNIV FED RIO DE JANEIRO, LAB HIDROGENIO",RIO DE JANEIRO RJ,"CIDADE UNIV, ILHA DO FUNDAO, BLOCO I 2000, S L I 146, RIO DE JANEIRO RJ, CEP21941-972, BRAZIL",1517-7076,,,MATERIA-BRAZIL,Materia,,2020,25.0,2,,,,,,,e-12623,10.1590/S1517-707620200002.1023,0.0,,,12.0,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Materials Science,MT4YX,,"Green Published, gold",,,2025-04-23,WOS:000554979500017,0,

The microstructural evaluation and phase identification were performed by field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The thermal shock test consisted of repeated cycles of rapid cooling between 900 degrees C and 400 degrees C. Prior to the thermal shock test, the specimen coated by Pt-electroplating, high-activity low-temperature (HALT) aluminizing and the thermal spray of YSZ ceramic layer. From surface towards the substrate; the coating consisted of 5 layers including: 7% YSZ, PtAl2 + beta-(Ni,Pt)Al, beta-(Ni,Pt)Al with fine precipitates rich in alpha-(Cr) and alpha-(W), precipitate-free beta-NiAl, and inter-diffusion zone next to the specimen surface. After the thermal shock test, spallation and delamination have been observed in the YSZ layer. The Pt-Al layer was found in upper and lower parts of the coating with different Pt concentration. Also, the chemical composition of the Pt-Al layer demonstrated the removal of PtAl2 particles and beta transformation to both gamma and gamma ' phases. Degradation of Pt-Al layer occurred by ratcheting the thermally grown oxide (TGO), rumpling, and cavitation. Comparison of weight changes showed that the thermal shock resistance is improved by Pt-Al-7% YSZ coating.","[Rabieifar, Arman; Nategh, Said; Afshar, M.

The causes of these cracks range from improper selection and use of materials to faulty design, and can have serious consequences. In buildings in which the structural integrity is not endangered, cracking, especially in interior spaces, constitutes a significant impairment of the building's serviceability. The repair costs for these cracks are often considerable. Fortunately, a cost-effective and lasting solution to this cracking problem can be found in the use of more elastic interior paints. In order to utilize this solution, it is essential to know the elastic properties of the paint; however, manufacturers often fail to provide adequate information in this respect. In addition, the European market lacks standardized procedures for quantitatively determining the elasticity of paint. By combining two independent mechanical test methods, it is attempted to obtain a quantitative determination of the strain of interior paints. The suitability and relevance of the test methods used is discussed on the basis of the results obtained. The tests used are the classical tensile test in accordance with DIN EN ISO 6892-1 and a modified 3-point bending test based on DIN EN ISO 178. In order to determine the strain, optical deformation analysis by means of digital image correlation (DIC) is used for both test methods.","[Radoevski, Aleksandar Milkov; Ghanbari, Razmik-Roger; Kolbitsch, Andreas] Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Bldg Construct & Technol, Bldg Construct & Maintenance, E206-04,Karlspl 13-206-04, A-1040 Vienna, Austria; [Hoeflinger, Michael] Dr PECH Ziviltechniker GmbH, Ziviltechnikergesell Bauingn, Johann Str Gasse 32-11, A-1040 Vienna, Austria; [Spitzenberger, Edmund] Univ Appl Sci Vienna, Dept Bldg & Design, FH Campus,Wien Favoritenstr 226, A-1100 Vienna, Austria",Technische Universitat Wien,"Radoevski, AM (corresponding author), Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Bldg Construct & Technol, Bldg Construct & Maintenance, E206-04,Karlspl 13-206-04, A-1040 Vienna, Austria.",a.radoevski@gmx.at; hoeflinger@zt-pech.at; edmund.spitzenberger@fh-campuswien.ac.at; roger.ghanbari@yahoo.com; andreas.kolbitsch@tuwien.ac.at,,"Radoevski, Aleksandar Milkov/0000-0002-4155-5622; Kolbitsch, Andreas/0000-0003-1702-3738",,,,,25.0,1,1,0,6,"UNIV FED RIO DE JANEIRO, LAB HIDROGENIO",RIO DE JANEIRO RJ,"CIDADE UNIV, ILHA DO FUNDAO, BLOCO I 2000, S L I 146, RIO DE JANEIRO RJ, CEP21941-972, BRAZIL",1517-7076,,,MATERIA-BRAZIL,Materia,,2020,25.0,3,,,,,,,e-12799,10.1590/S1517-707620200003.1099,0.0,,,12.0,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Materials Science,NX1VR,,"gold, Green Published",,,2025-04-23,WOS:000575505100007,0,

The polymodal roughness of the zinc surface resulting from laser and heat treatment allows one to achieve its superhydrophobization upon layer-by-layer passivation with SDDP and TAS as well as to increase the protective properties of the thin films formed by them. Apparently, the surface morphology obtained by such treatment provides better adhesion of the first phosphonate layer. In combination with a strong siloxane network in the top layer, this determines the high protective and hydrophobic properties of the coatings and their stability over time. The most effective is layer-by-layer passivation of zinc in SDDP and OTES solutions with preliminary laser texturing of the surface, which allows one to obtain resistant coatings with high protective and hydrophobic properties in a humid atmosphere. In the presence of OTES, which is more hydrophobic than VTMS and has a relatively long alkyl, a stable highly ordered siloxane layer is formed on the zinc surface, which is capable of blocking existing defects in the film formed by the chemisorbed alkylphosphonate.","[Redkina, G., V; Sergienko, A.

Analysis of open-ended responses confirmed that Job Impact and Camp Embeddedness were the primary motivations for seasonal camp staff to return and that Compensation, Poor Job Fit, and Other Opportunities were likely drivers of turnover. This study helps paint a picture of the key factors that bring back seasonal staff and the factors, both controllable and uncontrollable, that lead camp staff to pursue other opportunities. Findings may be especially useful to professionals in the camping industry interested in seeking out potential camp staff and retaining staff year over year.","[Richmond, Dan; Sibthorp, Jim] Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Bialeschki, M.

The aim of the study entertained herein was to evaluate the physical characteristics of PICC, through application of the standards ABNT NBR ISO 10555-1:2003 and ABNT NBR ISO 10555-3:2003, and compare the results produced in the analysis of PICC at the beginning of their production process (extruded catheters only) with those obtained in the analysis of the finished product. Experimental tests were performed in PICC manufactured by a domestic manufacturer between the years 2011 and 2012. The data was gathered from tests performed on both catheters that were just extruded, i.e. without painting the demarcations, cutting and other processes related with quality assurance, and on catheters after completion of the overall manufacturing process. In the present study, one included all stages of the catheter production process that can generate some type of modification in the product that could impart risks to the patients needing to use them. The catheters were analyzed for strength to rupture, radiopacity, flow characteristics, leakage of fluid under pressure, and occurrence of air leak in the suction tube assembly, as advocated by the NBR ISO 10555-1:2003 and NBR ISO 10555-3:2003 standards The results obtained were satisfactory in all analyses performed, except for the resistance to rupture, which did not meet the specifications advocated by the standards for catheters made of silicone. One has also examined catheters made of polyurethane, which in turn did meet the standards with regard to resistance to rupture. As standards do not specify important points to be taken into account for conducting tests unequivocally, suggestions were made for revision of those standards.","[Rosa Mitelmao, Fabiana Cristina; Mangini Filho, Salvador; de Oliveira Junior, Jose Martins] Univ Sorocaba, LaFINAU Lab Appl Nucl Phys, BR-18023000 Sorocaba, SP, Brazil; [Chaud, Marco Vinicius] Univ Sorocaba, LaBNUS Lab Biomat & Nanotechnol, Technol Pk Sorocaba, BR-18078005 Sorocaba, SP, Brazil; [Duarte Carvalho Vila, Marta Maria; Cardoso Figueiredo Balcao, Victor Manuel] Univ Sorocaba, PhageLab Lab Biotilms & Bacteriophages, BR-18023000 Sorocaba, SP, Brazil; [Cardoso Figueiredo Balcao, Victor Manuel] Univ Aveiro, Dept Biol, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Cardoso Figueiredo Balcao, Victor Manuel] Univ Aveiro, CESAM, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal",Universidade de Sorocaba; Universidade de Sorocaba; Universidade de Sorocaba; Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade de Aveiro,"Mitelmao, FCR (corresponding author), Univ Sorocaba, LaFINAU Lab Appl Nucl Phys, BR-18023000 Sorocaba, SP, Brazil.",fmitelmao@ivasculardobrasil.com.br; salvador.mangini@prof.uniso.br; mar-co.chaud@prof.uniso.br; marta.vila@prof.uniso.br; victor.balcao@prof.uniso.br; jose.oliveira@prof.uniso.br,"Chaud, Marco/C-7690-2012; Vila, Marta/G-1342-2014; Balcao, Victor/I-2182-2012; Vila, Marta/GPT-0392-2022; Oliveira Junior, Jose Martins de/I-4910-2013","MITELMAO, FABIANA/0000-0002-4937-8739; Balcao, Victor/0000-0003-0772-2834; Vila, Marta/0000-0002-0198-7076; Oliveira Junior, Jose Martins de/0000-0001-6435-1908; Chaud, Marco/0000-0003-3618-8415","Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP, Sao Paulo, Brazil) [2012/15651-4, 2013/03181-6, 2016/08884-3, 2016/12234-4]; FAPESP (Sao Paulo, Brazil) [2018/05522-9]; CNPq, National Council for Scientific and Technological Development -Brazil [306113/2014-7, 308208/2017-0, 309598/2014-1]","Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP, Sao Paulo, Brazil)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); FAPESP (Sao Paulo, Brazil)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); CNPq, National Council for Scientific and Technological Development -Brazil(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ))","Project funding by Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP, Sao Paulo, Brazil) (FAPESP Refs.

The phase formation and microstructure analysis of these sputtered oxides were studied using glass for the destructive test along with the device. The x-ray diffraction and cross-section scanning electron microscopy of sputtered glass confirmed a single-phase structure along with nearly equal desired deposition thickness. The thicknesses of sputtered films were estimated using variable angle ellipsometry and the same was confirmed from cross-section scanning electron micrograph. The chemical composition and oxidation state of thin films deposited on glass were established from x-ray photoemission spectroscopy. The ability of a fabricated device deposited with the antireflection layer in converting photon energy to electrical energy was studied using a solar simulator under 1 sun condition.

The best method for preventing corrosion of mild steel alloy is to use an impermeable layer over the target alloy. The coatings are not constantly impervious, and all coating techniques finally fail for various reasons and therefore, anticorrosion agents are added. The inhibition impact of new corrosion inhibitor entitled 5,5'-(1,4-phenylene)bis(N-benzylidene-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-amine) (PBTA) on the surface of mild steel corrosion in 1 M HCl media was studied using weight loss techniques. The surface of mild steel was exposed to investigated solution and evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Effects of the concentration of PBTA, acidic content, temperature variation and immersion time were investigated. PBTA has excellent inhibitive performance on the corrosion of mild steel in 1 M HCl solution and enhanced with an increase in PBTA inhibitor concentration, while decreasing with a decrease in immersion time and corrosion temperature. The adsorption of the synthesized corrosion inhibitor on the surface of mild steel obeys the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Various spectroscopic techniques such as H-1 NMR (Proton nuclear magnetic resonance), C-13 NMR (Carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance) and FTIR (Fourier-transform infrared) were used for confirmation of the structure of the corrosion inhibitor molecule.","[Salim, R.

It was shown that a durable corrosion-protective layer was formed due to the donor-acceptor bonds between iron and phosphorous atoms. No changes in the nature of the contact between the protective layer and the steel substrate were found upon heating in a spectrometer chamber (in vacuo) with simultaneous acquisition of X-ray electron spectra. Optical microscopy surface analysis revealed that, at room temperature, the nanocomposites in mineral oil formed separate conglomerates on the steel surface. The conglomerates disintegrated into individual nanoparticles at temperatures of 100-200 degrees C, and nanoparticles distributed over the entire surface. The interactions between the nanocomposite and iron led to the formation of a durable protective coating that hindered the attack of corrosive surface environments. The corrosion protection of alloy-free steel was studied by a Monicor corrosion meter. A sulfate-chloride solution simulating moisture condensate during atmospheric corrosion was used as the corrosive medium.

Compounds such as Cr7C3, Al13Co4 and aluminum-yttrium oxides Al5Y3O12 were also confirmed by TEM observation results. Owing to the rapidly cooling rates of the molten droplets, nano-crystalline phase was existed in the coating. The average microhardness of the coating was 640 HV0.1. Its high microhardness derived from the presence of certain volume fraction of hard Al2O3, Cr7C3 and TaC grains within the coating. After 1h of oxidation, oxides like CrO2 and Ta2O5 were formed when the coating exposed at the temperature up to 800 degrees C. At the temperature above 600 degrees C, the hardness of the coating remained at a high level (600 HV0.1). It possessed better high temperature softening resistance than H13 steel, indicated that the coating exhibited good mechanical properties at high temperature.","[Shi, Wei; Wu, Yuping; Hong, Sheng; Yang, Weihua; Wei, Zheng] Hohai Univ, Coll Mech & Mat, 8 Focheng West Rd, Nanjing 211100, Peoples R China",Hohai University,"Wu, YP; Hong, S (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Coll Mech & Mat, 8 Focheng West Rd, Nanjing 211100, Peoples R China.",wuyuping@hhu.edu.cn; hongsheng1988@126.com,"Wu, Yuping/ABA-6092-2022; Shi, Wei/F-5625-2010",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [51579087, 51609067]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2018B48914]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2018T110435]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation),"The research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 51579087 and 51609067), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. 2018B48914), and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No.2018T110435).",,39.0,1,1,2,16,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",,2053-1591,,MATER RES EXPRESS,Mater.

The major parameters such as porosity, crystallinity, mechanical properties, toughness and cell proliferation were manipulated by varying plasma power from 15 kW to 35 kW and content of GNPs. For the coating synthesized at all plasma power, GNPs were found to be retained by Raman spectroscopy. GNPs reinforcement has led to an improvement in the crystallinity of the composite coatings as compared to HA coatings. On the contrary to it, increase in plasma power from 15 kW to 35 kW resulted in decrease in crystallinity for all three individual coating. Further, Increment in plasma power from 15 kW to 35 kW delivered a significant enhancement in hardness, elastic modulus and fracture toughness up to 81%, 149% and 282% respectively for HA-1 wt% GNPs coating, while it improved to 20%, 50% and 173% respectively on the addition of 2 wt% GNPs in HA coating fabricated at 35 kW. Enhancement in hardness, elastic modulus and fracture toughness was due to three simultaneous reasons: (1) Reduction in porosity (2) Uniform dispersion of GNPs and (3) Toughening mechanism offered by GNPs. Further, the addition of GNPs showed a remarkable improvement in the rate of cell proliferation in the HA coating. A detailed discussion over the reasons behind every results have been made profoundly.","[Singh, Swarnima; Pandey, Krishna Kant; Rahman, O. S.

It is based on the quantitative determination of the inhibiting or activating effect of the additive depending on the concentration in the bath. Since the rate of metal deposition in the CVS cathodic cycle depends on the content of the additive in the electrolyte, the charge spent on stripping metal in the anodic cycle is proportional to the additive concentration and can be used as an analytical signal. To increase the stability of the results, measurements are carried out in a special cell with a rotating micro disk electrode, ensuring the constancy of hydrodynamic conditions at the electrode. The previously patented Korian method developed on basis CVS is adapted to the IPC brand potentiostats by means of a specialized application for a personal computer in addition to the standard program of the serial IPC device. This program allows you to fully automate the analysis of additives by controlling the operating modes of the potentiostat and processing the results obtained. The analysis results are presented in digital form and graphically. The principles of realization of the analysis of the various nature organic additives in various electrolytes (not only PCB) by the CVS method Korian are discussed. Specific examples show the possibilities of quantitative determination of the concentration of organic additives in industrial baths, their efficiency, consumption and stability during storage and electrolytic deposition of metal coatings. This method and the Korian hardware and software complex is used at many plants in Russia and abroad.","[Solodkova, L. N.; Kasatkin, V.

The effect of Ni doping was studied by adding various amounts of NiO, with x ranging from 0 to 1. Proportional amounts of ZnO, Fe2O3 and NiO were homogeneously mixed together by means of wet milling, followed by filtration and drying. Then, the mixtures were calcined at 1000 and 1100 degrees C for 3 h. XRD analysis of the undoped pigments revealed the presence of pure ZnFe2O4 in all synthesis conditions. The addition of NiO dopant into the ZnFe2O4 caused a gradual shift of the diffraction peaks toward higher angles due to the substitution of Zn2+ by the smaller Ni2+ to form the Zn(1-x)NixFe(2)O(4). Upon the increase of NiO doping content and calcination temperature, the color hue of the pigments changed from light brown to brownish black, and a gradual reduction of the NIR reflectance was observed. For the black pigments which were synthesized at 1100 degrees C, the band-gap energy changed from 2.05 eV for ZnFe2O4 (x=0) to 1.65 eV for NiFe2O4 (x=1).

The deposition of polymers onto metal substrate has been developed by controlling the temperature in conventional thermal spray process. Properties of final polymer coating are investigated, such as microstructural, crystallization, mechanical, friction and corrosion properties. The objective of this is to deposit a polymer coating by controlling temperature in conventional thermal spray process and evaluate the coating properties for specific applications such as polymer coating on vacuum pump screws as abrasion resistant coating and on Kevlar fabric to provide strength for bullet proof soft armor vest for defense application. This study reports that as-sprayed coating can be used without post processing like annealing and filing. As-sprayed PEEK coating has a considerable hardness and adhesion strength found to be 17 5 HV, 16 3.0 MPa, respectively. However, post annealing treatment may introduce further improvements in wear and friction resistant properties of the final polymer coating system. The microhardness value has increased from 17 HV to 29 HV in average. The annealed semi-crystalline coatings exhibit the slightly lower friction coefficient than amorphous coating (as-sprayed); 0.31 in average versus 0.36. The wear rate of annealed coating is lower than the as-sprayed coating, decreased by approx 50% (10.5 in average versus 20.5 x 10(- 6) mm(3) N-1 m(-1)).

Therefore, it is concluded that the spin coater assembled in this study at low costs successfully can produce TiO2 electrodes for DSSCs.","[Teixeira, Edwalder Silva; Nunes, Vanja Fontenele; Franca Maia Junior, Paulo Herbet; Lima, Francisco Marcone; Pinho, Diego Caitano; Leite Almeida, Ana Fabiola; Aguiar Freire, Francisco Nivaldo] Univ Fed Ceara, Lab Filmes Finos & Energias Renovaveis LAFFER, Campus Pici, BR-60455900 Fortaleza, CE, Brazil; [Cavalcanti, Raphael Coelho] Univ Fortaleza, Fortaleza, CE, Brazil; [Moreira de Souza Filho, Men de Sa] Inst Fed Ceara, Fortaleza, CE, Brazil; [Moreira de Souza Filho, Men de Sa] Embrapa Agroind Trop, Fortaleza, CE, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Ceara; Universidade Fortaleza; Instituto Federal do Ceara (IFCE); Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA); EMBRAPA Trop Agroind,"Teixeira, ES (corresponding author), Univ Fed Ceara, Lab Filmes Finos & Energias Renovaveis LAFFER, Campus Pici, BR-60455900 Fortaleza, CE, Brazil.",edwalderteixeira@hotmail.com,"Leite Almeida, Ana Fabiola/Y-4853-2019","Leite Almeida, Ana Fabiola/0000-0002-8867-5453",Brazilian research agency Fundacao cearense de apoio ao desenvolvimento cientifico e tecnologico (FUNCAP),Brazilian research agency Fundacao cearense de apoio ao desenvolvimento cientifico e tecnologico (FUNCAP),"The authors would like to acknowledge the Brazilian research agency Fundacao cearense de apoio ao desenvolvimento cientifico e tecnologico (FUNCAP) for the financial support, the Laboratorio de Filmes Finos e Energias Renovaveis LAFFER for the assistance throughout the research.",,52.0,3,3,3,21,"UNIV FED SAO CARLOS, DEPT ENGENHARIA MATERIALS",SAO CARLOS,"LABORATORIA DE MATERIAIS VITREOS, CAIXA POSTAL 676, SAO CARLOS, 13565-905SP, BRAZIL",1516-1439,1980-5373,,MATER RES-IBERO-AM J,Mater.

For this, electrolytical solutions containing hexamethylenetetramine and sodium fluoride were used. The morphology and chemical composition of formed coatings were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Also, salt spray test, hydrogen evolution and electrochemical tests (potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy) were conducted in order to study the corrosion behavior of the coated samples. It was found that the use of low frequency pulsed current for the PEO process reduces the film porosity and increases its thickness, compared with PEO films obtained by continuous anodization. The effect of the pulsed current signal was also analyzed for a two steps PEO process, observing changes in the morphological characteristics of the coatings which allow a better corrosion according electrochemical tests (short term corrosion measurements). However, long term tests results as hydrogen evolution and salt spray tests, indicated the opposite. Both the film porosity and thickness were affected by either the pulsing of the current or the use of a two-step process.","[Toro, L.; Calderon, D.; Galindez, Y.; Calderon, J.; Echeverria, F.

The process of dissolving and washing out of the primordial soil layer of the nutrients from urea, encapsulated by superphosphate shells in soil columns, was studied according to agrochemical techniques. The purpose of the work is to determine the parameters of the investigated process, based on which the previously developed physical model of soil washing of moving nitrogen forms, based on experimental data. The process of changing the loss of nitrogen from the soil when using different types of fertilizers depending on the amount of washing was studied by simulation. Mathematically, the process is described in general terms as a linear differential equation of the first order in partial derivatives. The solution of the equation under the initial and boundary conditions allowed to calculate the parameters of the model describing the nature of changes in the losses of nitrogen from the soil column. Comparison of calculated and experimental data showed a coincidence of values with a correlation coefficient above 0.96 for investigated nitrogen fertilizers with different composition of the phosphate-containing coating.","[Vakal, Viktoriia; Vakal, Serhii] Sumy State Univ, Sci & Res Inst Mineral Fertilizers & Pigments, Kharkivska St, UA-40003 Sumy, Ukraine; [Pavlenko, Ivan] Sumy State Univ, Fac Tech Syst & Energy Efficient Technol, Dept Gen Mech & Machine Dynam, 2 Rymskogo Korsakova St, UA-40007 Sumy, Ukraine; [Hurets, Larisa] Sumy State Univ, Fac Tech Syst & Energy Efficient Technol, Dept Appl Ecol, 2 Rymskogo Korsakova St, UA-40007 Sumy, Ukraine; [Ochowiak, Marek] Poznan Univ Tech, Fac Chem Technol, Dept Chem Engn & Equipment, 5 M Sklodowska Curie Sq, PL-60965 Poznan, Poland",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Sumy State University; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Sumy State University; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Sumy State University; Poznan University of Technology,"Pavlenko, I (corresponding author), Sumy State Univ, Fac Tech Syst & Energy Efficient Technol, Dept Gen Mech & Machine Dynam, 2 Rymskogo Korsakova St, UA-40007 Sumy, Ukraine.",i.pavlenko@omdm.sumdu.edu.ua,"Ochowiak, Marek/F-9587-2014; Pavlenko, Ivan/F-3772-2019","Vakal, Viktoriia/0000-0003-2208-7162; Vakal, Serhii/0000-0002-3547-4930; Pavlenko, Ivan/0000-0002-6136-1040; Ochowiak, Marek/0000-0003-1543-9967; Hurets, Larysa/0000-0002-2318-4223",Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine [0117U003931],Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine,The theoretical part of the research was provided by the project Development and Implementation of Energy Efficient Modular Separation Devices for Oil and Gas Purification Equipment (state reg. no. 0117U003931) ordered by the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine.,,29.0,8,8,0,8,BUDAPEST UNIV TECHNOLOGY ECONOMICS,BUDAPEST,"PERIODICA POLYTECHNICA, BUDAPEST, 1521, HUNGARY",0324-5853,1587-3765,,PERIOD POLYTECH-CHEM,Period.

The adherend used in this study is a S690 low-alloy steel whereas the adhesive is a 2-component epoxy-amine adhesive (Araldite 2015). The steel surface is subjected to different surface pre-treatment methods such as mechanical abrasion, grit blasting, zirconium conversion treatment and silane treatment. The effect of these different pre-treatments on the surface morphology, roughness and chemistry is addressed. Single-lap joint tests were performed at ambient conditions to assess the initial bond strength of the joint. Static wedge tests were performed in saltwater immersions to study the environmental ageing of the adhesive joints. Unloaded delamination of adhesive films from the steel surface was studied by means of scanning Kelvin probe (SKP) at high relative humidity. This unique combination of different techniques allows thorough evaluations of the bond performance under different environmental and loading conditions. Experimental results indicate that surface roughening plays an important role in the initial adhesion in the single-lap joint test but a minor role in the durability of the bonded steel surfaces. The improved initial adhesion is mainly attributed to the increased interfacial bond area at higher surface roughness. The presence of complex texture or morphology shows a more profound effect than the average roughness on both the initial adhesion and the durability of the interfacial adhesion. The results from the static wedge test show the large contribution of mechanical interlocking, caused by texturing of the surface, on the durability of the interfacial adhesion. In the absence of complex texture, surfaces with altered chemistry by zirconium- or silane treatment exhibit a significant increase of the initial bonding strength due to enhanced physicochemical interactions across the interface. Assessment of the interfacial delamination kinetics by SKP show that despite the absence of any surface topography, chemically altered surfaces prove to have higher resistance to delamination.","[van Dam, J.

Graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) are good candidates for reducing friction and wear, and suspension high velocity oxy-fuel (SHVOF) thermal spray is a promising technique for their scalable and fast deposition, but it can expose them to excessive heat. In this work, we explore radial injection of GNPs in SHVOF thermal spray as a means of reducing their interaction with the hot flame while still allowing a high momentum transfer and effective deposition. Feedstock injection parameters, such as flowrate, injection angle and position, were studied using high-speed imaging and particles temperature and velocity monitoring at different flame powers using Accuraspray 4.0. Unlubricated ball-on-flat sliding wear tests against an alumina counterbody ball showed a friction coefficient reduction up to a factor 10 compared to the bare substrate, down to 0.07. The deposited layer of GNPs protects the underlying substrate by allowing low-friction dry sliding. A transmission electron microscopy study showed GNPs preserved crystallinity after spray and became amorphized and wrinkled upon wear. This study focused on GNPs but could be relevant to other heat- and oxidation-sensitive materials such as polymers, nitrides and 2D materials.","[Venturi, F.; Hussain, T.] Univ Nottingham, Fac Engn, Univ Pk, Nottingham, England",University of Nottingham,"Venturi, F (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Fac Engn, Univ Pk, Nottingham, England.",federico.venturi@nottingham.ac.uk,"Hussain, Tanvir/A-5006-2011; Venturi, Federico/F-7890-2015","Hussain, Tanvir/0000-0001-8024-829X; Venturi, Federico/0000-0002-3156-4736",,,,,26.0,12,12,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1059-9630,1544-1016,,J THERM SPRAY TECHN,J.

Similar studies were conducted with uncoated electrodes. The influence of a duration of an exposure of the electrodes in a solution (0.25-96 hours) on kinetics of electrode processes and corrosion rate of steel is considered. In the absence of hydrogen sulfide, a presence of a superhydrophobic coating on steel causes a decrease in the corrosion rate by 67, 13, and 2 times after 0.25, 24, and 48 hours of exposure in a chloride solution. In time, the cathodic process slows down and the anodic one accelerates, especially in a case of electrodes with a hydrophobic coating. In the presence of hydrogen sulfide in a chloride solution, steel with a superhydrophobic coating is characterized by more than an order of magnitude low corrosion rate, compared with unprotected samples during a 96-hour exposure of the electrodes. In this case, there is a slowdown in the anodic reaction and acceleration of the cathodic one compared to the solution without hydrogen sulfide. The corrosion process proceeds with anodic control.","[Vigdorovich, V., I; Tsygankova, L.

Requirement of light weight materials with high mechanical properties as a function of direction leads to the development of Aluminium based Functionally Graded Materials (FGM). Two different matrix metal blends 601AC and 201 AC are used for the comparison. Mechanical Alloying technique (MA) is used to blend the metal powders. The FGM specimens with 2 layers, 3 layers and 5 layers are fabricated using Powder Metallurgy (P/M) technique. B4C with Nickel coating and without Nickel coating is used as particulate. Two different average particle size of B4C (20 mu m and 50 mu m) was selected. The configurations used for the FGMs are 0%/5% for 2 layered specimen, 0%/5%/10% for 3 layered specimen and 0%/5%/10%/15%/20% for five layered specimen. Specimens are prepared according to ASTM B925-3 standard for micro-hardness test and compressive strength test. Graphs are plotted in terms of number of layers, particle size, sintering temperature, and coating condition. From the experiments it is observed that, number of layers influences the hardness and compressive strength. The average specimen hardness is enhanced from 55 HV for two layered FGM to 73 HV for three layered FGM. The compressive strength is increase from 613 MPa for three layered specimen without Nickel coated B4C to 732 Mpa for three layered specimen with Nickel coating. Best possible combination of all parameters is observed from the experiment is particle size of 20 mu m, sintering temperature of 570 degrees C, and B4C particulate with Nickel coating.

The object of the study is a topocomposite that consists a coating of titanium nitride deposited by magnetron sputtering in vacuum on a substrate of aluminum alloy. Comparing the balance of energy spent at all stages of indentation using model and experimental diagrams of indentation, the contribution of work dissipated on the deformation to the layered system, on the interfacial delamination at the coating-substrate interface and on the formation of through circular cracks in the coating is estimated.

Deposition of a SiO(2)surface coating was attempted via reaction of the powder with an amino silane prior to the final heat treatment. It was found that either the presence of small amounts of Al3+, or the compositional gradient resulting from a two step co-precipitation, caused increased crystal growth of the NMCA in comparison to NMC811. This led to improved cyclability in LP40 electrolyte. However, the SiO(2)coating appeared incomplete and negatively impacted performance. Crystal cleavage preferably on the {001} planes was observed after 100 charge-discharge cycles, with consequent cathode electrolyte interphase formation in the crystal cracks. This is believed to cause capacity decay via lithium loss, and increased charge transfer resistance. An FEC based electrolyte improved the cyclability in all cases and even under extreme conditions (45 degrees C and upper cycling potential of 4.5 V) NMCA showed a capacity retention of 85% after 100 cycles.","[Wagner, Nils P.; Tolchard, Julian R.; Tron, Artur; Gaertner, Heiko] SINTEF Ind, Dept Sustainable Energy Technol, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Wagner, Nils P.; Pollen, Harald N.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Vullum, Per E.] SINTEF Ind, Dept Mat & Nanotechnol, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Vullum, Per E.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Phys, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",SINTEF; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); SINTEF; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Wagner, NP (corresponding author), SINTEF Ind, Dept Sustainable Energy Technol, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.;Wagner, NP (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",nils.peter.wagner@sintef.no,"Tron, Artur/ABC-2465-2021; Tolchard, Julian/B-7889-2010","Vullum, Per Erik/0000-0001-7968-4879; Tron, Artur/0000-0002-6565-8247; Tolchard, Julian/0000-0003-0934-4515",Research Council of Norway [280910],Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),The authors gratefully acknowledge the Research Council of Norway for financial support of the HiCath project under the grant number 280910.,,17.0,4,4,2,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",2059-8521,,,MRS ADV,MRS Adv.,,2020,5.0,27-28,,,SI,,1433.0,1440,,10.1557/adv.2020.90,0.0,,,8.0,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Materials Science,MC1US,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2025-04-23,WOS:000543081600004,0,

However, in that context it is often unclear which attitude object respondents have in mind, and thus what their answers refer to. This paper uses a representative sample of 3,195 Germans who reported which groups they think of when thinking about foreigners living in Germany. We found that Germans disproportionately think of groups who are Muslim, and that such salience is associated with more negative attitudes towards foreigners. This holds true when controlling for attitudes towards Muslims; in fact, thinking of Muslim groups when thinking about foreigners moderates the relationship between anti-Muslim and anti-foreigner attitudes. The relationships were weaker when respondents think of Turks, a large and long-standing minority in Germany, suggesting an attenuation of the links through familiarity or intergroup contacts. No relationship was found between thinking of refugees and attitudes towards foreigners. Implications for research are discussed, particularly regarding the interpretation of self-reported attitudes towards foreigners and the study of populist strategies.","[Wallrich, Lukas; West, Keon] Goldsmiths Univ London, Dept Psychol, London SE14 6NW, England; [Rutland, Adam] Univ Exeter, Dept Psychol, Exeter, Devon, England",University of London; Goldsmiths University London; University of Exeter,"Wallrich, L (corresponding author), Goldsmiths Univ London, Dept Psychol, London SE14 6NW, England.",l.wallrich@gold.ac.uk,,"West, Keon/0000-0002-9955-661X; Wallrich, Lukas/0000-0003-2121-5177",,,,,42.0,14,14,2,5,PSYCHOPEN,TRIER,"UNIVERSITAETSRING 15, TRIER, 54296, GERMANY",,2195-3325,,J SOC POLIT PSYCHOL,J.

In present study, Ni60 alloy thin-walled samples were fabricated using laser metal deposition (LMD) technology on H13 steel substrate which is usually used as mould material. The microstructure and mechanical properties (microhardness and wear resistance) of LMD Ni60 alloy were investigated. The results show that the LMD Ni60 alloy sample is mainly composed of Ni, Ni3Fe, Ni3B, Ni3Si, CrB, Cr5B3 and Cr7C3. The microstructures of the sample mainly include Ni-B-Si eutectics, Ni columnar dendrites and precipitates (boride and carbide). In the region with faster cooling rate of the sample, eutectics take a larger proportion, meanwhile precipitates are refined and dispersed uniformly. So hardness of the region can reach 950 HV. In the interlayer region, eutectics decrease while Ni dendrites increase because of the influence of remelting. The hardness of this region is about 750 HV. Wear resistance tests indicated that the wear resistance of LMD Ni60 alloy is about 9 times of H13 steel.","[Wang, Wenquan; Liu, Liang; Zhang, Xinge] Jilin Univ, Coll Mat Sci & Engn, Changchun 130025, Peoples R China; [Shi, Zimu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Solid Phys, Key Lab Mat Phys, Hefei 230031, Peoples R China; [Tian, Yingtao] Univ Lancaster, Dept Engn, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England; [Lin, Jixing] Zhejiang Ind & Trade Vocat Coll, Dept Mat Engn, Wenzhou 325003, Peoples R China",Jilin University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Lancaster University,"Zhang, XG (corresponding author), Jilin Univ, Coll Mat Sci & Engn, Changchun 130025, Peoples R China.",zhangxinge@jlu.edu.cn,"Tian, Yingtao/AGG-2786-2022","Tian, Yingtao/0000-0002-3602-259X; , Liang/0000-0002-6183-1671","Jilin Province [440050316A14, SXGJQY2017-14]; Jilin University [440050316A14, SXGJQY2017-14]; Wenzhou Science and Technology Bureau [ZG2017032]",Jilin Province; Jilin University(Jilin University); Wenzhou Science and Technology Bureau,"This work was financially supported by the co-construction project between Jilin Province and Jilin University (440050316A14, SXGJQY2017-14) as well as Wenzhou Science and Technology Bureau through Project Grant ZG2017032.",,19.0,14,15,8,75,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",,2053-1591,,MATER RES EXPRESS,Mater.

Through adjusting the growth temperature (600 degrees C-800 degrees C) and other process parameters, using the chemical vapor deposition method, single or double layers of graphene grown on a copper substrate. Without control pressure, this way improved controllability of graphene preparation and reduced production costs. The morphology, quality of graphene was revealed by SEM, XPS, Raman, UV-vis. Additionally, the conductive test results illustrate that the graphene on the surface of the copper matrix slightly soars the conductivity of copper. This is due to the process of annealing and growth that alters the structure of the material. The results of the Tafel experiments, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements and cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests demonstrate that the graphene film can effectively improve the corrosion resistance of the copper matrix. Compared to the single layer graphene coating, double-layers graphene coating has a better anti-corrosion effect. This is in that the double-layers graphene coating can block the defects of the single-layer graphene in time, and better prevent the intrusion of Cl- into the copper matrix, so as to achieve a good anti-corrosion effect.","[Wu, Wanwan; Liu, Ping; Chen, Xiaohong; Fan, Jun] Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol, Met Based Adv Power Mat Key Lab, 516 Jungong Rd, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Chen, Shaohuo; Liang, Dong] GRINMGroup Co Ltd, State Key Lab Nonferrous Met & Proc, Beijing 100088, Peoples R China; [Chen, Shaohuo; Liang, Dong] GRIMAT Engn Inst Co Ltd, Beijing 101407, Peoples R China; [Chen, Shaohuo; Liang, Dong] Gen Res Inst Nonferrous Met, Beijing 100088, Peoples R China; [Chen, Shaohuo] Aluminum Corp China Co Ltd, Beijing 100082, Peoples R China",University of Shanghai for Science & Technology; General Research Institute for Nonferrous Metals,"Liu, P (corresponding author), Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol, Met Based Adv Power Mat Key Lab, 516 Jungong Rd, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",wuwanwanwan@126.com; junfanlxy@163.com; chenshaohua006@163.com,"wu, wanwan/JCE-8881-2023; Liu, Ping/ABD-5632-2021",,State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks [2018GZKF03007]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFB0306405]; National Science Foundation of China [51201107],State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks; National Key Research and Development Program of China(National Key Research & Development Program of China); National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported by the State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks (Grant No. 2018GZKF03007), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No.2017YFB0306405) and the National Science Foundation of China (Grant No.51201107).",,42.0,5,5,1,25,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",,2053-1591,,MATER RES EXPRESS,Mater.

Slip and twin associated with plastic deformation changed the orientation of crystallographic planes. The surface containing highly concentrated orientation of (0002) basal plane has higher corrosion resistance.

The Fe-Cr-Ni cladding coatings composed of austenites and a few eutectic ferrites. And the content of eutectic ferrite in the grain boundary decreased with the decreasing Cr/Ni ratio of the blending powder.

This research exhibits that the Fe-Cr-Ni coatings and laser cladding processing have a potential engineering application value on hypereutectoid carbon steel.","[Zhou, Lei; Liu, Yanhui; Zhu, Lingjie; Li, Yongjiu; Xiong, Anhui] Shanghai Univ Engn Sci, Sch Mat Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhiwei] Shanghai Univ Engn Sci, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Engineering Science; Shanghai University of Engineering Science,"Liu, YH (corresponding author), Shanghai Univ Engn Sci, Sch Mat Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",scopey@163.com,"Li, Zhiwei/AAS-6513-2021; Zhou, Lei/AAP-5661-2020; LIU, Y.H./N-1476-2015; Zhu, Lingjie/AAY-5165-2021",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [51471105, 61675074, 61705127]; Shanghai Science and Technology Committee Innovation Grant [17JC1400600, 17JC1400601]; Graduate Students' Innovative Research Projects of Shanghai University of Engineering Science [E3-0903-18-01136]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Science and Technology Committee Innovation Grant; Graduate Students' Innovative Research Projects of Shanghai University of Engineering Science,"This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51471105, 61675074, 61705127), Shanghai Science and Technology Committee Innovation Grant (17JC1400600, 17JC1400601), Graduate Students' Innovative Research Projects of Shanghai University of Engineering Science (E3-0903-18-01136).",,25.0,8,8,10,39,IOP Publishing Ltd,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",,2053-1591,,MATER RES EXPRESS,Mater.

The results show that the phase structures of the SmTaO4 ceramics are a monoclinic phase (space group: I2 (5)), the Sm3TaO7 ceramics are an ordered orthorhombic phase (space group: Ccmm), and the SmTa3O9 ceramics are an orthorhombic phase (space group: Cmmm). Macromolecular and crystal structures of Sm3TaO7 and SmTa3O9 are more complex than those of SmTaO4, which can enhance phonon scattering and reduce thermal conductivity. Compared with those of SmTaO4 and SmTa3O9, Sm3TaO7 has the smallest grain size, indicating that a small grain size has an effect on strength and ensures material stability. Because of a distorted TaO6 octahedron and a high concentration of cation vacancy in the lattice of SmTa3O9, its thermal conductivity increases with increasing temperature. Compared with that of 7-8 YSZ, Sm3TaO7 has a low thermal conductivity (1.3-1.7 Wm(-1)K(-1) at 100 degrees C-900 degrees C), and its minimum thermal conductivity is nearly 30% lower than that of YSZ. The Sm3TaO7 ceramics have the highest TECs at approximately 9.82 x 10(-6) K-1 at 1200 degrees C, which is close to that of 7-8 YSZ (approximately 10 x 10(-6)). This indicates that Sm3TaO7 has the potential to be employed as a thermal barrier coating.","[Zhou, Ying; Gan, Guoyou; Ge, Zhenhua; Feng, Jing] Kunming Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Mat Sci & Engn, Kunming 650093, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Ying] Yunnan Prov Acad Sci & Technol, Kunming 650093, Yunnan, Peoples R China",Kunming University of Science & Technology,"Zhou, Y (corresponding author), Kunming Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Mat Sci & Engn, Kunming 650093, Yunnan, Peoples R China.;Zhou, Y (corresponding author), Yunnan Prov Acad Sci & Technol, Kunming 650093, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",zhouying602@126.com,"GE, ZHENHUA/L-2040-2013",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [51762028]; Yunnan Province Key Research and Development Program [2018BA067]; Foundation Research Project of Yunnan Province,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Yunnan Province Key Research and Development Program; Foundation Research Project of Yunnan Province,"This research is conducted under the support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51762028), and the authors acknowledge funding from the Yunnan Province Key Research and Development Program (Grant No. 2018BA067) and the Foundation Research Project of Yunnan Province.",,36.0,13,14,2,19,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",,2053-1591,,MATER RES EXPRESS,Mater.

N1 and N2 nanoparticles are loaded with rhodamine 6G and capped with bulky poly(ethylene glycol) derivatives bearing ester groups (1 and 2). N3-N4 nanoparticles are loaded with sulforhodamine B and capped with self-immolative derivatives bearing ester moieties. In the absence of esterase enzyme negligible cargo release from N1, N3 and N4 nanoparticles is observed whereas a remarkable release for N2 is obtained most likely due to the formation of an irregular coating on the outer surface of the nanoparticles. In contrast, a marked delivery is found in N1, N3, and N4 in the presence of esterase enzyme. The delivery rate is related to the hydrophilic/hydrophobic character of the coating shell. The use of hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) derivatives as gating ensembles on N1 and N2 enables an easy access of esterase to the ester moieties with subsequent fast cargo release. On the other hand, the presence of a hydrophobic monolayer on N3 and N4 partially hinders esterase enzyme access to the ester groups and the rate of cargo release was decreased.

The Si/Al content was adjusted through the electrical power on the Si and Al targets, while the O/N content was controlled through the O-2 flow piped to the substrate in addition to the N-2 flow at the targets. The structure and morphology of the coatings were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), while the elemental composition was obtained from Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) and heavy ion elastic recoil detection analysis (ERDA). The chemical states of the elements in the coatings were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Based on analytical results, a model describing the microstructural evolution of the Al-O-N and also previously studied Al-Si-N [1, 2, 3, 4] coatings with O and Si content, respectively, is established. The universality of the microstructural evolution of these coatings with the concentration of the added element is attributed to the extra valence electron (e(?)) that must be incorporated into the AlN wurtzite host lattice. In the case of Al-O-N, this additional valence charge arises from the e (?) acceptor O replacing N in the AlN wurtzite lattice, while the e (?) donor Si substituting Al fulfills that role in the Al-Si-N system. In view of future applications of ternary Al-O-N and quaternary Al-Si-O-N transparent protective coatings, their mechanical properties such as residual stress (?), hardness (HD) and Young?s modulus (E) were obtained from the curvature of films deposited onto thin substrates and by nanoindentation, respectively. Moderate compressive stress levels between ?0.2 and ?0.5 GPa, which suppress crack formation and film-substrate delamination, could be obtained together with HD values around 25?GPa.","[Fischer, Maria; Trant, Mathis; Thorwarth, Kerstin; Crockett, Rowena; Hug, Hans Josef] Empa, Lab Nanoscale Mat Sci, Swiss Fed Labs Mat Sci & Technol, Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Patscheider, Jorg] Evatec AG, Solut Design, Trubbach, Switzerland; [Hug, Hans Josef] Univ Basel, Dept Phys, Basel, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science & Technology (EMPA); University of Basel,"Fischer, M (corresponding author), Empa, Swiss Fed Labs Mat Sci & Technol, Uberlandstr 129, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland.",minname@gmx.net,,"Crockett, Rowena/0000-0001-9006-9500","Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [200021_150095]; Competence Centre for Materials Science and Technology; Empa, Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [200021_150095] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)","Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Competence Centre for Materials Science and Technology; Empa, Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF))","This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [200021_150095], the Competence Centre for Materials Science and Technology [-]; Empa, Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology [-].",,45.0,5,5,3,64,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1468-6996,1878-5514,,SCI TECHNOL ADV MAT,Sci.

Polymers combined with active biomolecules come to the forefront for the design of antibacterial materials that can address this encounter. In this work, we investigated the photo-crosslinking approach of UV-sensitive benzophenone molecule (BP) with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) polymer within electrospun fibres. The BP and PVP solutions allowed fabricating polymer mats that were subsequently functionalised with antibacterial lysozyme. The physical properties of the crosslinked electrospun fibres were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The average diameter of the obtained fibres decreased from 290 ? 50 nm to 270 ? 70 nm upon the addition of the crosslinking molecules and then to 240 ? 80 nm and 180 ? 90 nm after subsequent crosslinking reaction at an increasing time: 3 and 5 h, respectively. The peak force quantitative nanomechanical mapping (PF-QNM) indicated the increase of DMT modulus of obtained cross-linked fibres from 4.1 ? 0.8 GPa to 7.2 ? 0.5 GPa. Furthermore, the successful crosslinking reaction of PVP and BP solution into hydrogels was investigated in terms of examining photo-crosslinking mechanism and was confirmed by rheology, Raman, Fourier transform infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance. Finally, lysozyme was successfully encapsulated within cross-linked PVP-BP hydrogels and these were successfully electrospun into mats which were found to be as effective antibacterial agents as pure lysozyme molecules. The dissolution rate of photo cross-linked PVP mats was observed to increase in comparison to pure PVP electrospun mats which opened a potential route for their use as antibacterial, on-demand, dissolvable coatings for various biomedical applications.","[Maciejewska, Barbara M.; Wychowaniec, Jacek K.; Wozniak-Budych, Marta; Popenda, Lukasz; Warowicka, Alicja; Golba, Klaudia; Litowczenko, Jagoda; Wereszczynska, Beata; Jurga, Stefan] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, NanoBioMed Ctr, Umultowska 85, PL-61614 Poznan, Poland; [Warowicka, Alicja] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Dept Anim Physiol & Dev, Fac Biol, Poznan, Poland; [Litowczenko, Jagoda] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Dept Mol Virol, Fac Biol, Poznan, Poland; [Fojud, Zbigniew; Wereszczynska, Beata] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Dept Macromol Phys, Fac Phys, Poznan, Poland; [Wychowaniec, Jacek K.] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Chem, Dublin 4, Ireland",Adam Mickiewicz University; Adam Mickiewicz University; Adam Mickiewicz University; Adam Mickiewicz University; University College Dublin,"Maciejewska, BM (corresponding author), Adam Mickiewicz Univ, NanoBioMed Ctr, Umultowska 85, PL-61614 Poznan, Poland.",bmacieje@amu.edu.pl; jacek.wychowaniec@ucd.ie,"Warowicka, Alicja/GRR-1987-2022; Litowczenko, Jagoda/HKN-6902-2023; Woźniak-Budych, Marta/AAD-2909-2020; Maciejewska, Barbara/KHE-0393-2024; Wychowaniec, Jacek/ABB-7081-2021; Jurga, Stefan/E-8862-2017; Popenda, Lukasz/J-7386-2015; Fojud, Zbigniew/G-2830-2011","Litowczenko, Jagoda/0000-0002-8515-2171; Warowicka, Alicja/0000-0003-4301-9855; Wychowaniec, Jacek/0000-0002-6597-5242; Wereszczynska, Beata/0000-0003-3013-212X; Jurga, Stefan/0000-0002-1665-6077; Popenda, Lukasz/0000-0003-1117-3081; Fojud, Zbigniew/0000-0003-4810-1858; Zebrowska, Klaudia/0000-0002-6177-0194; Wozniak-Budych, Marta/0000-0002-7694-9023","project 'Srodowiskowe interdyscyplinarne studia doktoranckie w zakresie nanotechnologii' under the European Social Fund - Operational Programme Knowledge Education Development, Axis III Higher Education for Economy and Development, Action 3.2 PhD Programme [POWR.03.02.00-00-I032/16]","project 'Srodowiskowe interdyscyplinarne studia doktoranckie w zakresie nanotechnologii' under the European Social Fund - Operational Programme Knowledge Education Development, Axis III Higher Education for Economy and Development, Action 3.2 PhD Programme","This work is co-financed by the project 'Srodowiskowe interdyscyplinarne studia doktoranckie w zakresie nanotechnologii' No. POWR.03.02.00-00-I032/16 under the European Social Fund -Operational Programme Knowledge Education Development, Axis III Higher Education for Economy and Development, Action 3.2 PhD Programme.",,59.0,24,24,0,76,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1468-6996,1878-5514,,SCI TECHNOL ADV MAT,Sci.

This research is aimed at preparing and developing a process for producing polyHIPE for use as a scaffold in tissue engineering applications. Poly(styrene/ethylene glycol dimethacrylate) (poly(S/EGDMA)) loaded with hydroxyapatite was used to prepare the polyHIPE. Further improvement on hydrophilicity and biological response to tissue fluids of the polyHIPE porous polymer was carried out using a nanolayer coating via the layer-by-layer polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) technique. Three types of chemicals were used for coating on the surface of the polyHIPE porous polymer such as poly(sodium 4-styrene sulfonate) (PSS), gelatin (GEL), and alginic acid (ALG). The change in surface properties of the modified poly(S/EGDMA)HIPE was characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy and contact angle measurement. Further assessments consisted of cytotoxicity testing, cell attachment, and proliferation of L929, fibroblast-like cells that were seeded on the surface of the polyHIPE porous polymer. A three-dimensional structure poly(S/EGDMA)HIPE porous polymer with high porosity was successfully prepared. Moreover, it was found that surface modification encouraged poly(S/EGDMA)HIPE with a hydrophilic nanolayer, as observed by the decrease in contact angle degree and cell adhesion of L929 fibroblast-like cells, indicating that the poly(S/EGDMA)HIPE porous polymer was effectively improved by using the layer-by-layer technique. It was revealed by MTT assay that the poly(S/EGDMA)HIPE porous polymer coated with a nanolayer of a polyelectrolyte multilayer led to an enhancement in the amount of cell adhesion and proliferation on the modified poly(S/EGDMA)HIPE porous polymer. Additionally, the most effective polyelectrolyte solution for improving cell adhesion of the poly(S/EGDMA)HIPE was PSS.","[Preechawong, Jitima; Noulta, Kornkanok; Dubas, Stephan T.; Nithitanakul, Manit] Chulalongkorn Univ, Petr & Petrochem Coll, Bangkok 10330, Thailand; [Preechawong, Jitima; Nithitanakul, Manit] Chulalongkorn Univ, Ctr Excellence Petrochem & Mat Technol, Bangkok 10330, Thailand; [Sapsrithong, Pornsri] King Mongkuts Univ Technol North Bangkok, Coll Ind Technol, Dept Mech Engn Technol, Bangkok 10800, Thailand",Chulalongkorn University; Chulalongkorn University; King Mongkuts University of Technology North Bangkok,"Nithitanakul, M (corresponding author), Chulalongkorn Univ, Petr & Petrochem Coll, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.;Nithitanakul, M (corresponding author), Chulalongkorn Univ, Ctr Excellence Petrochem & Mat Technol, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.",manit.n@chula.ac.th,"dubas, stephan/Z-2875-2019; Sapsrithong, Pornsri/GQH-5156-2022; Preechawong, Jitima/GQO-8820-2022","Preechawong, Jitima/0000-0003-4660-1779; dubas, stephan/0000-0002-7188-3096","College of Industrial Technology, King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok [CIT 0201/2016]; Center of Excellence on Petrochemical and Materials Technology, Chulalongkorn University","College of Industrial Technology, King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok; Center of Excellence on Petrochemical and Materials Technology, Chulalongkorn University","This research was funded by College of Industrial Technology, King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok (Grant no.

The aim of the work was to obtain a film-forming product for antimicrobial treatment of surfaces. To improve the physical, mechanical, and film-forming properties of the compositions, three natural stabilizing agents were added to the formulation: gelatine, guar gum and hydroxyethyl cellulose. Formulations with different concentrations of each stabilizer were tested, and the physicochemical properties of the obtained products were measured. The size of zinc oxide particles in obtained compositions varied from 232 to 692 nm. The compositions had a slight acidic nature. Their pH ranged from 6.84 to 6.99. The average density of products was equal to 1.37 x 10(3) (kg/m(3)). It was confirmed that zinc oxide nanoparticles do not penetrate through a model dermal membrane which is a desired effect concerning their toxicity. The antimicrobial activity of the obtained compositions was assessed against Aspergillus niger strain. After 24 h of studying, the growth inhibition was in 71% greater than in reference material. After statistical analysis of the results, it was concluded in order to achieve the most desirable physicochemical and utilitarian properties, the concentrations of gelatine, guar gum and hydroxyethylcellulose should be equal to 0.5%, 0.03% and 0.055%, respectively.","[Pulit-Prociak, Jolanta; Chwastowski, Jaroslaw; Rodrigues, Laura Bittencourt; Banach, Marcin] Cracow Univ Technol, Fac Chem Engn & Technol, Inst Chem & Inorgan Technol, Warszawska 24, PL-31155 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Technology,"Pulit-Prociak, J (corresponding author), Cracow Univ Technol, Fac Chem Engn & Technol, Inst Chem & Inorgan Technol, Warszawska 24, PL-31155 Krakow, Poland.",jolantapulit@chemia.pk.edu.pl,,"Chwastowski, Jaroslaw/0000-0002-0827-2348",National Science Centre [UMO-2016/23/D/ST8/00016],"National Science Centre(National Science Centre, Poland)",This work is the result of the research project No. [UMO-2016/23/D/ST8/00016] funded by the National Science Centre.,,58.0,12,13,3,18,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1468-6996,1878-5514,,SCI TECHNOL ADV MAT,Sci.

In this review, we highlight recent advances in the assembly of solution-processed 2D materials into thin films and the use of them for electronics and optoelectronics. We first present an overview about typical approaches to assemble solution-processed 2D materials into desired structures, including layer-by-layer assembly, Langmuir?Blodgett assembly, spin coating, electrophoretic deposition, inkjet printing, and vacuum filtration. Then, electronic and optoelectronic applications of such assembly films are presented, such as thin-film transistors, transparent conductive films, mechanical and chemical sensors, photodetectors and optoelectronic devices, as well as flexible and printed electronics.

Herein, deliberate interfacial modification of graphite electrodes via direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering of nanoscale layers of Cu and Ni is employed to increase the overpotential for Li deposition and suppress Li plating under high rate charge conditions. Due to their nanoscale, the deposited surface films have minimal impact (similar to 0.16% decrease) on cell level theoretical energy density. Interfacial properties of the anodes are thoroughly characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and spatially resolved mapping X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. The spectroscopic measurements indicate that the Cu and Ni coatings form oxide upon exposure to an ambient environment, but they are reduced within the electrochemical cell and remain in a metallic state. Li plating is quantified by X-ray diffraction and associated electrochemistry measurements revealing that the surface treatment effectively reduces the quantity of the plated Li metal by similar to 50% compared to untreated electrodes. These results establish an effective method using interfacial modification to achieve deliberate control of Li-metal deposition overpotential and reduction of lithium plating on graphite.","[Tallman, Killian R.; Zhang, Bingjie; Marschilok, Amy C.; Takeuchi, Kenneth J.; Takeuchi, Esther S.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Chem, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Marschilok, Amy C.; Takeuchi, Kenneth J.; Takeuchi, Esther S.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Mat Sci & Chem Engn, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Wang, Lei; Yan, Shan; Bock, David C.; Takeuchi, Esther S.] Brookhaven Natl Lab, Energy Sci Directorate, Upton, NY 11973 USA; [Thompson, Katherine] Brookhaven Natl Lab, SULI Program, Upton, NY 11973 USA; [Tong, Xiao] Brookhaven Natl Lab, Ctr Funct Nanomat, Upton, NY 11973 USA; [Thieme, Juergen; Kiss, Andrew] Brookhaven Natl Lab, Natl Synchrotron Light Source 2, Upton, NY 11973 USA; [Thompson, Katherine; Marschilok, Amy C.] Mansfield Univ Penn, Dept Chem & Phys, Mansfield, PA 16933 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; Stony Brook University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; Stony Brook University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Brookhaven National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Brookhaven National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Brookhaven National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Brookhaven National Laboratory; Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE); Mansfield University - Pennsylvania,"Takeuchi, ES (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Chem, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.;Takeuchi, ES (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Mat Sci & Chem Engn, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.;Bock, DC; Takeuchi, ES (corresponding author), Brookhaven Natl Lab, Energy Sci Directorate, Upton, NY 11973 USA.",dbock@bnl.gov; esther.takeuchi@stonybrook.edu,"Takeuchi, Esther/D-1825-2014; Zhang, Bingjie/H-4902-2018; Marschilok, Amy/D-1821-2014","Wang, Lei/0000-0002-6348-8344; Marschilok, Amy/0000-0001-9174-0474","U.S. Department of Energy Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy under the Advanced Battery Materials Research program [DE-EE0007785]; Center for Mesoscale Transport Properties, an Energy Frontier Research Center - DOE-BES [DE-SC0012673]; DOE Office of Science [DE-SC0012704]; Center for Functional Nanomaterials, U.S. DOE Office of Science Facility, at Brookhaven National Laboratory [DE-SC0012704]; Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internship (SULI) Program, Brookhaven National Laboratory","U.S. Department of Energy Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy under the Advanced Battery Materials Research program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Center for Mesoscale Transport Properties, an Energy Frontier Research Center - DOE-BES(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); DOE Office of Science(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Center for Functional Nanomaterials, U.S. DOE Office of Science Facility, at Brookhaven National Laboratory(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internship (SULI) Program, Brookhaven National Laboratory","This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy under the Advanced Battery Materials Research program, award DE-EE0007785.

As SiC concentration further increased to 4 g/m(2), colonies of SiC particle with nonwetting areas of filler metal formed at the interface, resulting in a decrease in the bonding strength. By using 5 mu m SiC particles, the bonding strength was enhanced as SiC concentration increased from 1 g/m(2) to 3 g/m(2) due to the removal of the oxide film. By further increasing SiC concentration to 16 g/m(2), the strength was constantly improved because of the dislocation strengthening effect generated at the SiC particle layer/filler metal interface.

The method consists of determining the structural compliance of an embedded material system based on the definition of reduced modulus that takes into account the effective contact point of the indenter with a rough sample surface. The method does not require the ratio of mean contact stress to reduced modulus squared to remain constant with penetration depth so as to be applicable to an embedded material system with a sharp elastic discontinuity. When applied to the dynamic indentation data of a viscoelastic paint film embedded in a similar to 10 times stiffer medium, the proposed method correctly predicted the flat modulus profile of the film across the thickness, in contrast to existing methods that significantly overestimated the modulus near the sample edge.

For both monolithic and mechanically stacked tandem devices, a semi-transparent perovskite top solar cell, including a transparent contact, is required. Usually, this contact consists of a metal oxide buffer layer and a sputtered transparent conductive oxide. In this work, semi-transparent perovskite solar cells in the regular n-i-p structure are presented with tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) directly sputtered on the hole conducting material Spiro-OMeTAD. ITO process parameters such as sputter power, temperature, and pressure in the chamber are systematically varied. While a low temperature of 50 degrees C is crucial for good device performance, a low sputter power has only a slight effect, and an increased chamber pressure has no influence on device performance. For the 5 x 5 mm(2) perovskite cell with a planar front side, a 105 nm thick ITO layer with a sheet resistance of 44 Omega sq(-1) allowing for the omission of grid fingers and a MgF2 antireflection coating are used to improve transmission into the solar cells.

The deposited Cr2AlC layers showed high purity with theoretical densities up to 93%, although some secondary phases were detected after the deposition process. On top of this MAX phase layer, a porous yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) was deposited by atmospheric plasma spraying. The system was tested under realistic thermal loading conditions using a burner rig facility, achieving surface and substrate temperatures of 1400 degrees C and 1050 degrees C, respectively. The system failed after 745 cycles mainly for three reasons: (i) open porosity of the bond coat layer, (ii) oxidation of secondary phases, and (iii) inter-diffusion. Nevertheless, these results show a high potential of Cr2AlC and other Al-based MAX phases as bond coat material for high-temperature applications. Furthermore, future challenges to transfer MAX phases as eventual bond coat or protective layer are discussed.","[Gonzalez-Julian, Jesus; Mauer, Georg; Sebold, Doris; Mack, Daniel E.; Vassen, Robert] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res, Mat Synth & Proc IEK 1, D-52425 Julich, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich,"Gonzalez-Julian, J (corresponding author), Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res, Mat Synth & Proc IEK 1, D-52425 Julich, Germany.",j.gonzalez@fz-juelich.de,"Gonzalez, Jesus/ABF-5651-2021; Sebold, Doris/MEP-6307-2025","Mack, Daniel Emil/0000-0002-0365-4582; Mauer, Georg/0000-0002-0840-8006",Germany's Federal Ministry of Education and Research [03SF0534],Germany's Federal Ministry of Education and Research,"Germany's Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Grant/Award Number: 03SF0534",,43.0,48,50,5,61,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-7820,1551-2916,,J AM CERAM SOC,J.

However, they are associated with bacterial infection and biofilm formation due to the suboptimal surface properties of the elastic materials used for the catheters. Although there are several antibacterial coating technologies to modify the surface properties of the catheter including hydrophilic polymeric coating, the risk of infection is still high given the absence of reactive functional groups on the surface of elastomers. In this study, we describe the use of catechol-functionalized hydrophilic polymers and explore strategies to create antibacterial hydrogel coatings. Three different types of catechol-functionalized polymers, chitosan, hyaluronic acid, and human serum albumin were synthesized and deposited using simple dip-coating method. All of the tested polymers could coat different types of elastomers widely used for urethral catheters independent of the surface properties while the thickness of the coating could be controlled by the number of depositions. The coating formed stable water-containing lubricant surface beneficial as a physical repellant of microbial attachment. In addition, the coating could be combined with additional antibacterial agents such as silver nanoparticles to maximize the antibacterial effect on the surface of urethral catheter materials.","[Yang, Kisuk; Lee, Eunjee A.; Liu, Sophie S.; Zhou, Angela; Karp, Jeffrey M.; Lee, Yuhan] Harvard Med Sch, Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Engn Med,Dept Med,Ctr Nanomed, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Yang, Kisuk; Lee, Eunjee A.; Karp, Jeffrey M.; Lee, Yuhan] Harvard MIT, Div Hlth Sci Technol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Yang, Kisuk; Kabli, Sara; Alsudir, Samar A.; Albrahim, Shahad; Almalik, Abdulaziz M.; Karp, Jeffrey M.; Alhasan, All H.; Lee, Yuhan] KACST, KACST BWH Ctr Excellence Biomed, Joint Ctr Excellence Program, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Yang, Kisuk; Karp, Jeffrey M.] Harvard & MIT, Prote Platform, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA USA; [Kim, Kyuri; Lee, Haeshin] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Chem, Daejeon, South Korea; [Kabli, Sara; Alsudir, Samar A.; Almalik, Abdulaziz M.; Alhasan, All H.] KACST, Natl Ctr Pharmaceut Technol, Life Sci & Environm Res Inst, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Park, Tae Gwan] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Biol Sci, Daejeon, South Korea; [Alhasan, All H.] Affaisal Univ, Coll Sci & Gen Studies, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Harvard University Medical Affiliates; Brigham & Women's Hospital; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Harvard University; King Abdulaziz City for Science & Technology; Harvard University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Broad Institute; Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST); King Abdulaziz City for Science & Technology; Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST),"Lee, Y (corresponding author), Harvard Med Sch, Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Engn Med,Dept Med,Ctr Nanomed, Boston, MA 02115 USA.;Lee, Y (corresponding author), Harvard MIT, Div Hlth Sci Technol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",ylee21@bwh.harvard.edu,"Lee, Yuhan/JGD-7021-2023; Liu, Sophie/MGV-2686-2025; Lee, Haeshin/C-1720-2011; Alsudir, Samar/HHM-2061-2022; Karp, Jeffrey/JPA-5353-2023; Alhasan, Ali/AAT-5290-2021; PARK, TAE/C-1552-2011",/0000-0002-0616-022X,"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education of Korea [2012R1A6A3A03041166]; Korea Institute for Advancement of Technology [N0002123]; Saudi National Industrial Development and Logistics Program (NIDLP) [20-0103, 20-0051]",Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education of Korea; Korea Institute for Advancement of Technology; Saudi National Industrial Development and Logistics Program (NIDLP),"This work was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education of Korea (2012R1A6A3A03041166) and Korea Institute for Advancement of Technology (N0002123) to YL.

The effect of the HA concentration (5, 10 and 15 g.L-1) on the microstructure and corrosion behavior of coatings in the electrolyte was studied. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques were used to study the microstructure and composition. Polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were applied to the bare and coated samples in simulated body fluid (SBF) to determine the resistance behavior and the kinetics of corrosion coatings. The results showed that HA could be distributed inside the coating along with MgO and Mg-3 (PO4)(2). Moreover, it was found that the porosity declined and the thickness of coatings increased with increases in the HA concentration. The results also indicated that the corrosion resistance of AZ31B Mg alloy was enhanced by coating with any amount of HA. The highest corrosion resistance was obtained with an electrolyte comprising 15 g.L-1 HA. The lowest corrosion current density (1.99 x 10(-6) A.cm(-2)) was monitored in respect to the highest corrosion resistance.","[Chaharmahali, Razieh; Fattah-Alhosseini, Arash; Esfahani, Hamid] Bu Ali Sina Univ, Dept Mat Engn, Hamadan 6517838695, Hamadan, Iran",Bu Ali Sina University,"Fattah-Alhosseini, A (corresponding author), Bu Ali Sina Univ, Dept Mat Engn, Hamadan 6517838695, Hamadan, Iran.",arash.fattah@gmail.com,"Fattah-alhosseini, Arash/Y-7170-2019","Chaharmahali, Razieh/0000-0002-6291-8613; Fattah-alhosseini, Arash/0000-0001-9560-0049; Esfahani, Hamid/0000-0003-1246-733X",,,,,43.0,57,58,2,27,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2187-0764,,,J ASIAN CERAM SOC,J.

The microstructure of SiOx coatings was analyzed using X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), nanoindentation, and spectroscopic ellipsometry. The composition ranged from oxygen-rich oxides with large silanol OH content to hybrid oxides with larger organic content, while refractive index varied from 1.45 to 1.5 depending on the specimen. Reduced moduli of coatings obtained by nanoindentation varied between 15 and 59 GPa and could be correlated with permeability to oxygen and water vapor through the existence of porosity in a broader sense. It can be concluded that the barrier properties are the result of a complex interplay of microstructural features, with porosity, silanol, and carbon content playing important roles in the final thin film properties.","[Framil, David; Leterrier, Yves] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, LPAC, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Van Gompel, Matthias; Bourgeois, Florian] Comelec SA, La Chaux De Fonds, Switzerland; [Furno, Ivo] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, SPC, Lausanne, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne,"Leterrier, Y (corresponding author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, LPAC, Lausanne, Switzerland.",yves.ieterrier@epfl.ch,"Furno, Ivo/N-1944-2017","Framil, David/0000-0002-4032-8508",Swiss Innovation Agency (Innosuisse Grant) [25575.1 PFIW-IW],Swiss Innovation Agency (Innosuisse Grant),This work was supported by Swiss Innovation Agency (Innosuisse Grant 25575.1 PFIW-IW).,,87.0,9,9,0,13,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-8016,,,FRONT MATER,Front.

But there is little information available about the novel adhesion strength, fracture mechanism and interfacial bonding of NiTi//Al2O3 composites at the atomic scale. Therefore, the work of adhesion (W-ad), interfacial energy (gamma) and electronic structure of NiTi(111)//alpha-Al2O3(0001) interfaces have been calculated using first-principles calculations. For the models with the same stacking site, O-terminated interfaces have larger Wad and smaller g than Al-terminated interfaces. For the models with same termination, the stability of Ni(Ti)-Al interfaces decreases with the order of HCP > MT > OT, while the stability of Ni(Ti)-O interfaces decreases as MT > HCP > OT. The Ti-O-MT interface belongs to the most stable interfacial configuration with the smallest interface energy among all studied interfaces. Using Griffith's theory, it is predicted that the mechanical failure of NiTi//alpha-Al2O3 interfaces are inclined to initiate in the interior of NiTi bulk or at the interface rather than Al2O3 side in most cases. Furthermore, density of states and electron density difference analysis indicate that the dominant interfacial adhesion mechanism for the Ni-Al interfaces is the formation of mainly metallic Ti-Al and Ni-Al bonds, while the Ti-O interface exhibits mixed covalent/ionic character with higher interfacial binding strength.

Pull-off adhesion tests were performed in the coatings systems, to verify if the microcapsules presence affect the adhesion and/or cohesion coating properties. The EIS results showed that microcapsules change the coating electrochemical response, but the samples visual aspect suggests that the microcapsules improve the barrier properties of the microcapsules systems. The coating system containing the microcapsules showed a significant self-healing effect when stressed by a mechanical defect and the higher concentration (15 wt. %) of microcapsules provided a better self-healing protection, with better anticorrosive performance.

But the incorporation of dissimilar metals accelerates matrix corrosion, additive polymers cannot offer a long-term structural stability, and multi-step methods are complicated and costly. Hereon, stable micro-craters and nano-terraces on AA5052 sheet with enhanced water repellence and durable corrosion resistance are fabricated via low-cost subtractive manufacturing (SM) strategy. After fluoridation process, as-fabricated hierarchical structures possess highlighted self-cleaning and anti-adhesion capabilities. The following electrochemical test shows that the resultant surface effectively acts as a barrier against seawater infiltration suggesting superior anti-corrosion capacity. Meanwhile, the bacterial colony count test shows that the surface also possesses excellent resistance to microbiological adhesion. Such economic, efficient and environmental SM process is of great potential in fabricating multifunctional Al alloys with durable anti-corrosion, super-hydrophobic and bacteriostatic behaviors.

Here, considering the pivotal role of micro-nano textures in enhancing the stability and lifespan of ice-repellent surfaces, grating textures with micro-nano tertiary structures on aluminum alloy surface were directly constructed through picosecond laser processing. These hierarchically textured surfaces exhibit low-temperature-adaptive water repellency, which delays frozen time and drops frozen temperature. The above scenario was fundamentally understood from viewpoint of both wettability and thermodynamics. These results are extremely important for fabricating superhydrophobic metallic surface with long lifespan and delayed frozen performance without any chemical modification. (C) 2019 The Authors.

In this work, we report a facile strategy to synthesize carbon nanofiber/MnOx core-shell composites (CNF@MnOx) in order to collaborate their advantage for high-performance microwave absorption application. Through a simple ozone pretreatment process, ultra-thin MnOx nanoflakes can be uniformly coated onto CNFs by a hydrothermal method. The mixture of several MnOx forms coexists in CNF@MnOx composites because of the readily available crystalline phase transformation from different manganese oxides. The investigation of microwave absorption properties shows that the absorbing capabilities CNF@MnOx composites have significant improvement compared to the pure CNFs and most of single-phase manganese oxides. The minimum reflection loss for CNF@MnOx can arrive at -47.2 dB at 9.4 GHz with a thickness of 2.8 mm, and the widest effective absorption bandwidth was measured to be 5.0 GHz. Furthermore, polymorphic MnOx endows CNF@MnOx with selective-frequency microwave absorption. The dramatic enhancement of microwave absorption is ascribed to dielectric loss, magnetic loss, impedance matching and geometrical effect. Hence, the present CNF@MnOx may be a capable candidate for strong-absorption, broadband and lightweight microwave absorber. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Initiation of underfilm corrosion by application of group I chloride salts to a penetrative coating defect produces an apparent cathodic-driven coating delamination, where the disbondment distance increases linearly with time at high relative humidity, although filiform corrosion (FFC) is also observed in the vicinity of the defect. The disbondment process occurs both in the presence and absence of oxygen, indicating that hydrogen evolution comprises the predominant underfilm cathodic reaction. Post-corrosion elemental analysis of the delaminated region shows an abundance of group I cation, but no chloride. When magnesium chloride or HCl are used to initiate corrosion, then only FFC is produced. The mechanism is discussed in terms of net anodic dissolution at the defect coupled with underfilm cathodic hydrogen evolution, producing organic coating disbondment under conditions where cations are able to transport ionic current within a zone of increased pH.","[Williams, Geraint; Kousis, Christos; McMurray, Neil] Swansea Univ Bay Campus, Coll Engn, Mat Res Ctr, Swansea SA1 8EN, W Glam, Wales; [Keil, Patrick] BASF Coatings GmbH, Glasuritstr 1, D-48165 Munster, Germany",BASF,"Williams, G (corresponding author), Swansea Univ Bay Campus, Coll Engn, Mat Res Ctr, Swansea SA1 8EN, W Glam, Wales.",geraint.williams@swansea.ac.uk,,"Kousis, Christos/0000-0002-6097-7791; Williams, Geraint/0000-0002-3399-5142",BASF's Coatings division; Swansea University's EPSRC,BASF's Coatings division(BASF); Swansea University's EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"The support of BASF's Coatings division and Swansea University's EPSRC-funded Centre for Doctoral Training in advanced functional coatings (COATED2), administered through the Materials and Manufacturing Academy, is acknowledged.",,29.0,25,25,3,22,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",,2397-2106,,NPJ MAT DEGRAD,NPJ Mater.

The removal of aged or detrimental polymeric coatings from works of art is a common operation in conservation, and nanostructured fluids (NSFs), such as aqueous swollen micelles and oil-in-water (o/w) microemulsions, are used as an alternative to non-confined organic solvents, which pose a series of non-negligible drawbacks. NSFs effectiveness in removing polymeric coatings has been thoroughly demonstrated in the last decades, while their cleaning mechanism is still under investigation. The present work deepens the knowledge on the removal mechanisms of NSFs, studying the interaction of a four-component NSF with four different types of acrylic and vinyl polymer films cast from solutions or aqueous polymer latexes on three substrates (glass, marble, and polystyrene) with different hydrophilicity and wettability. NSFs were applied either as non-confined or confined in cellulose poultices (traditionally employed by conservators), or in highly retentive chemical gels, observing the influence of the confining matrix on the removal process. It was found that the NSF/polymer film interaction is greatly dependent on the film structure and composition. Films formed from solvent solutions can be swollen by water/organic solvents mixtures or dewetted when a surfactant is added to the cleaning fluid; films formed from polymer latexes, on the other hand, are generally swollen even just by water alone, but poorly dewet. The substrate also plays an important role in the removal of polymer films formed from solutions, for instance the removal of an acrylic polymer from polystyrene could be achieved only through highly selective cleaning using NSF-loaded chemical hydrogels. These results can be key for conservators, providing innovative solutions to face new challenges in art preservation.","[Giorgi, Rodorico; Baglioni, Piero] Univ Florence, Dept Chem, Sesto Fiorentino, Italy; Univ Florence, CSGI, Sesto Fiorentino, Italy",University of Florence; University of Florence,"Giorgi, R; Baglioni, P (corresponding author), Univ Florence, Dept Chem, Sesto Fiorentino, Italy.",giorgi@csgi.unifi.it; baglioni@csgi.unifi.it,"Giorgi, Rodorico/H-5080-2011; Chelazzi, David/H-9258-2012; Baglioni, Piero/B-1208-2011; Baglioni, Michele/AAF-3751-2019; Chelazzi, David/F-3356-2013","Chelazzi, David/0000-0001-9994-3356; Baglioni, Michele/0000-0003-1079-7298","European Union (CORDIS)-Project NANORESTART [H2020-NMP-21-2014/646063]; European Commission under the 7th Framework Programme through the Key Action: Strengthening the European Research Area, Research Infrastructures [226507]; PRIN 2017-MIUR","European Union (CORDIS)-Project NANORESTART; European Commission under the 7th Framework Programme through the Key Action: Strengthening the European Research Area, Research Infrastructures(European Union (EU)); PRIN 2017-MIUR(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","This work was supported by the European Union (CORDIS)-Project NANORESTART (H2020-NMP-21-2014/646063) and PRIN 2017-MIUR.

Suspension and gel-like precursor systems were compared for layer creation. The layers were characterized by their morphology (GIXRD), surface and thickness (SEM), as well as transparency (UV-visible spectroscopy). The best quality of layer (similar to 90% transmittance, 50-60 nm thickness, perfect covering) has been obtained by sol-gel technique starting from Al nitrate or Al acetate.

Both mechanisms were assessed for Zinc-Rich Epoxy (ZRE) coatings in the presence of Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) and exposure to a bioelectrolyte in order to study the evolution process during microbial corrosion conditions. The purpose of this study is to characterize in a comprehensive experimental platform the electrochemical response of a dual-protection zinc epoxy coating with different ratios of additive carbon nanotubes to active zinc particles upon exposure to a sulfate reducing consortium. Carbon nanotubes addition was found to affect both the prevailing mechanism at the coating interfaces and the formation of a biofilm at the coating surface that influenced the relatively dominance of the barrier protection mechanism. These multifunctional coatings with active particles could help to balance the charge transfer efficiency in terms of the sacrificial of zinc and barrier mechanisms, which influence biofilm formation and have potential consequences for biocorrosion on carbon steel.","[Castaneda, Homero] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, College Stn, TX 77845 USA; [Galicia, Monica] Univ Autonoma Ciudad Juarez, Inst Ciencias Biomed, Dept Ciencias Quim Biol, Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Universidad Autonoma de Ciudad Juarez,"Castaneda, H (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, College Stn, TX 77845 USA.",hcastaneda@tamu.edu,"Castaneda-Lopez, Homero/ABD-9323-2020","Galicia, Monica/0000-0003-1273-3204",,,,,23.0,6,6,1,29,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-8016,,,FRONT MATER,Front.

PMMA-PS/ZnO NPs solution was prepared by blending ZnO NPs with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)-Polystyrene (PS) with a molar ratio of 80% and 20% using solution mixing at concentrations of 2.5%, 5% and 10%. The dip-coating technique was used to get thin films of 300 nmthickness that are highly transparent and could be used for UV shielding. UV-vis spectrophotometer measurements show that the transmittance for PMMA-PS/ZnO thin films has strong absorption in UV region (lambda 300 nm) and high values of transmittance in the visible region. The transmittance of PMMA-PS lies in the range (60-68)% in the visible region. We found that the transmittance values increased gradually upon introducing the ZnO NPs in the films and exhibit a maximum value of 85% for PMMA-PS/10% NPs. This striking finding clearly indicates that the optical properties of the fabricated doped polymeric thin films are greatly improved byte incorporation of ZnO nanoparticles as dopants. Furthermore, we characterize the structure and the morphology of the obtained doped polymers using EDAX mapping and SEM micrographs. Our results indicate that Zn atoms have been distributed uniformly in the structure. As-prepared Transparent PMMA-PS/ZnO Polymeric Nanocomposite Films are of great quality and could be used for several important optical applications.","[Alsaad, A. M.; Al-Bataineh, Qais M.; Ahmad, A.

Although weight of particles is marginal, the total releasing area is more of a concern due to amount and volume of molecules. The aim of the study was to examine the fretting wear resistance of orthodontic and prosthetic alloy Ni-Cr-Mo samples coated with Ti(C, N) and to compare them with samples without any coating. Five groups of cylindrical shape samples (S1-S5) made of Ni-Cr-Mo were coated with Ti(C, N) layers with different content of C and N. The control group (S0) was without layer. The alloys underwent fretting wear resistance tests with amplitude 100 mu m, at frequency 0.8 Hz with averaged unit load: 5, 10, and 15 N for 15 min. The samples were subjected to microscopic observations using scanning electron microscope and a laser scanning microscope. Samples with Ti(C, N) coatings revealed higher fretting wear resistance. The wear in each case with Ti(C, N) coatings was over twice as low. The lowest wear and thus the highest resistance was demonstrated by sample S3 (1.02 mu m) whereas in control group-S0 (2.64 mu m). The use of Ti(C, N)-type coatings reduces the adverse effects of fretting wear, decreasing the amount of ions released during orthodontic treatment or wearing prosthesis.","[Banaszek, Katarzyna] Med Univ Lodz, Dept Gen Dent, Chair Restorat Dent, Pomorska 251, PL-92217 Lodz, Poland; [Klimek, Leszek] Lodz Univ Technol, Inst Mat Sci & Engn, Stefanowskiego 1-15, PL-90924 Lodz, Poland; [Dabrowski, Jan Ryszard] Bialystok Tech Univ, Dept Mat & Prod Engn, Wiejska 45C, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland; [Jastrzebski, Wojciech] Med Univ Lodz, Dept Dent Technol, Chair Restorat Dent, Pomorska 251, PL-92217 Lodz, Poland",Medical University Lodz; Lodz University of Technology; Bialystok University of Technology; Medical University Lodz,"Jastrzebski, W (corresponding author), Med Univ Lodz, Dept Dent Technol, Chair Restorat Dent, Pomorska 251, PL-92217 Lodz, Poland.",katarzyna.banaszek@umed.lodz.pl; leszek.klimek@umed.lodz.pl; j.dabrowski@pb.edu.pl; wojciechjastrzebski@tlen.pl,"; Klimek, Leszek/K-5958-2015","Jastrzebski, Wojciech/0000-0003-0703-3983; Klimek, Leszek/0000-0003-3617-8225; Banaszek, Katarzyna/0000-0001-8788-7625",Medical University of Lodz [502-03/2-148-06/502-24-077-19],Medical University of Lodz,Work carried out with funds from the Medical University of Lodz as part of the financing of research of young science workers and doctoral students.

The mechanism by which corrosion protection occurs has not been well understood as the couple involved are both good electron conductors. In this work, we demonstrate that Monel alloy coated with graphene quantum dots (GQD) changes the corrosion rate with a surge (increase) caused by the galvanic coupling of the two materials. This surge results in the protective layer formation on Monel to inhibit the corrosion. X-ray fluorescence spectrum of Monel (400) alloy showed the composition of it as Ni (67.05%) and Cu (29.42%). The Tafel experiments carried out in NaCl and Na2SO4 electrolytes showed an initial enhancement of the corrosion rate followed by a decrease upon successive polarizations. Monel coated with graphene oxide (an insulator) shows no initial enhancement of corrosion rate; the coated samples showed a lower corrosion rate in comparison to the uncoated samples. X-ray fluorescence, Fourier Transform spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman imaging studies have been carried out for understanding this transformation. Distinct peaks due to Ni-O stretching and Ni-O-H bending vibration were observed in the FTIR spectrum.","[Bopp, Charles; Santhanam, Kalathur] Rochester Inst Technol, Sch Chem & Mat Sci, Rochester, NY 14623 USA",Rochester Institute of Technology,"Santhanam, K (corresponding author), Rochester Inst Technol, Sch Chem & Mat Sci, Rochester, NY 14623 USA.",csb9445@rit.edu; ksssch@rit.edu,,"Santhanam, Kalathur/0000-0002-1378-7186","National Science Foundation [1604893]; Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Chem, Bioeng, Env, & Transp Sys [1604893] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Chem, Bioeng, Env, & Transp Sys(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG))",The project was carried out as an offshoot of the National Science Foundation grant award number (1604893) in search for stable metal supports for sensors.,,38.0,6,6,1,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2305-7084,,CHEMENGINEERING,ChemEngineering,DEC,2019,3.0,4,,,,,,,80,10.3390/chemengineering3040080,0.0,,,12.0,"Engineering, Chemical",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Engineering,VK3PR,,gold,,,2025-04-23,WOS:000682941000004,0,

The bioactivity assay revealed that the samples which received the coating with 1.5 SBF presented bioactive characteristic by the formation and development of the carbonated hydroxyapatite on the surface, in a superior way to the samples without coating, thus suggesting a fast osseointegration of the bone with the implant.

Three kinds of rGO/p-Fe3O4@PANI samples were prepared. The mass percentage of PANI in the samples was established. The mass ratio of rGO to p-Fe3O4 was changed to ameliorate the impedance matching and attenuation constant. Compared with rGO/p-Fe3O4, rGO/p-Fe3O4@PANI exhibits excellent electromagnetic wave absorption performance. When the mass ratio of rGO to p-Fe3O4 in the 40 wt% three-phase material is 1:5 and the thickness is 2.5 mm, the minimum RL of rGO/p-Fe3O4@PANI is -41.38 dB at 9.75 GHz and the effective absorption bandwidth to electromagnetic wave reaches 3.08 GHz (from 8.40 to 11.48 GHz), indicating that is a potentially attractive candidate for high efficiency electromagnetic wave absorbers.

Scanning electronic microscopy is utilized to detect the influence of HfO2 alloying effect on microstructure. Current paper indicates that the same numbers of Ta5+ and Ho3+ ions of HoTaO4 are substituted by Hf4+ cations, and it is defined as alloying effect. No crystal structural transition is introduced by HfO2 alloying effect, and circular pores are produced in HoTaO4. HfO2 alloying effect is efficient in decreasing thermal conductivity of HoTaO4 and it is contributed to the differences of ionic radius and atomic weight between Hf4+ ions and host cations (Ta5+ and Ho3+). The least experimental thermal conductivity is 0.8 W.K-1.m(-1) at 900 degrees C, which is detected in 6 and 9 mol%-HfO2 HoTaO4 ceramics.

The electrodeposition of Ni-MoS2 self-lubricating composite coating was assisted by magnetic stirring (Mag-NM) or ultrasonic oscillation (US-NM), respectively. A comparison of coating structure, depositing mechanism, and friction performance was investigated by means of XRD and SEM. Moreover, the influence of MoS2 concentration on the coating morphology and the friction performance was explored. The results demonstrated that the Ni-MoS2 composite coatings have superior antifriction performance compared to pure Ni coating. Comparing to the porous structure of Mag-NM coatings, the US-NM coatings obtained compact structures with well-dispersive MoS2 particles.

However, it is a challenging task because of the strong autofluorescence of liquid petroleum products in the visible range and the chemically active and harsh medium. Therefore, strongly luminescent, near-infrared (NIR) fluorophores with long-term stability are needed. The use of NIR quantum dots (QDs), such as lead chalcogenides, seems to be the best approach; however, most widely used coatings do not provide enough stability, and QDs are quenched in a short time in liquid petroleum products. Here, we report for the first time the synthesis of highly luminescent, ultrasmall, NIR-emitting PbS and PbS/CdS QDs with a hybrid coating consisting of oleylamine (OLA), 1-dodecanethiol (DT), and poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA), adopting a simple, greener synthetic method. The photoluminescence (PL) emission wavelengths of these QDs were tuned between 700 and 1100 nm for detection with low-cost, widely used silicon detectors, which allows easy translation of such QDs as luminescent nanotags to serve as a means for the authentication of goods, such as petroleum. In the nanoparticle design, a thin layer of a CdS shell deposited by a cation-exchange process was adopted to enhance the emission intensity and stability of PbS QDs. The influence of postsynthetic ligand exchange of OLA with DT on the stability is also shown. PMAA in the coating provided a significant blue shift in the peak maxima, enhanced the luminescence intensity, and, most importantly, improved the long-term stability of QDs, especially in liquid petroleum products (oil, gasoline, and diesel). Such stability and size tunability was utilized to create binary barcodes. Hence, these QDs are shown as promising luminescent nanotags for liquid petroleum products. The development of such stable QD-based nanotags offers an invaluable use of nanotechnology for optical barcode generation.","[Durmusoglu, Emek G.; Turker, Yurdanur; Acar, Havva Yagci] Koc Univ, Surface Sci & Technol Ctr KUYTAM, Dept Chem, Rumelifeneri Yolu, TR-34450 Istanbul, Turkey; [Durmusoglu, Emek G.] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, LUMINOUS Ctr Excellence Semicond Lighting & Displ, Singapore 639798, Singapore",Koc University; Nanyang Technological University,"Acar, HY (corresponding author), Koc Univ, Surface Sci & Technol Ctr KUYTAM, Dept Chem, Rumelifeneri Yolu, TR-34450 Istanbul, Turkey.",fyagci@ku.edu.tr,,"Durmusoglu, Emek G./0000-0001-6840-8342; TURKER, YURDANUR/0000-0003-3611-6243; Yagci Acar, Havva/0000-0001-5601-8814","OPET Inc.

Cotton textiles have frequently been used in museums for canvas paintings. In the present project, the effect of Aspergillus niger on fluid flow rate of nanowollastonite-impregnated cotton textile specimens was investigated. Cotton specimens were impregnated with nanowollastonite (NW) suspension at four concentrations of 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% to be further compared with control specimens. Results showed that fluid flow in cotton textile was as high as 361.3 cm(3).s(-1) due to its high porous structure and very low compactness of fibers (low density). Impregnation with NW did not have a significant effect on fluid flow in cotton textile. Exposure to Aspergillus niger increased fluid flow in control specimens as a result of deterioration of cotton fibers. Exposure of NW-impregnated specimens at concentrations more than 20% to Aspergillus niger did not have any significant effect on fluid flow. In control specimens, fungus mycelium penetrated deep into the texture of textile. However, in NW-impregnated specimens, the fungus could not penetrate into the texture and deteriorate the specimens. It was concluded that NW can be recommended for textile industry and also works of art as they protect cotton textiles against Aspergillus niger while, do not diminishi its dying and paintability properties.","[Esmailpour, Ayoub] Shahid Rajaee Teacher Training Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Phys, Tehran 1678815811, Iran; [Taghiyari, Hamid R.; Kalantari, Amin] Shahid Rajaee Teacher Training Univ, Fac Mat Engn & New Technol, Wood Sci & Technol Dept, Tehran 1678815811, Iran; [Najafabadi, Reza Majidi] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Restorat, Cent Tehran Branch, Poonak Sq,Ash Esfehani Ave, Tehran 1584743311, Iran; [Papadopoulos, Antonios N.] Int Hellen Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Environm, GR-66100 Drama, Greece",Shahid Rajaee Teacher Training University (SRTTU); Shahid Rajaee Teacher Training University (SRTTU); Islamic Azad University; International Hellenic University,"Taghiyari, HR (corresponding author), Shahid Rajaee Teacher Training Univ, Fac Mat Engn & New Technol, Wood Sci & Technol Dept, Tehran 1678815811, Iran.;Papadopoulos, AN (corresponding author), Int Hellen Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Environm, GR-66100 Drama, Greece.",esmailpour@sru.ac.ir; htaghiyari@sru.ac.ir; r.majidi.n@gmail.com; amin1359k@yahoo.com; antpap@for.ihu.gr,"Taghiyari, Hamid Reza/ABG-1900-2021","Taghiyari, Hamid Reza/0000-0002-6952-0923; Papadopoulos, Antonios/0000-0002-6226-5309",,,,,22.0,4,4,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-9717,,PROCESSES,Processes,DEC,2019,7.0,12,,,,,,,901,10.3390/pr7120901,0.0,,,13.0,"Engineering, Chemical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering,KB6XK,,gold,,,2025-04-23,WOS:000506635300039,0,

First, Graphene oxide was deposited on cotton fibers by a simple 'dip and dry' method and chemically reduced into rGO/cotton fabric. MnO2 nanoparticles were accumulated on rGO/cotton fabric by in situ chemical deposition method. PANi layer was coated on rGO/MnO2/cotton fabric by in situ oxidative polymerization technique. A thin PANi coating layer acts as a protective layer on rGO/MnO2/cotton fabric to restrain MnO2 nanoparticles and rGO from dissolution in H2SO4 acidic electrolyte. The specific surface area of cotton electrode was measured using the Brenauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) results show that the cotton electrode has good capacitive behavior. The ternary cotton electrode exhibits high specific capacitance values of 888 F g(-1) and 252 F g(-1) at a discharge current density of 1 A g(-1) and 25 A g(-1) in 1MH(2)SO(4) electrolyte solution. The high areal specific capacitance of 444 Fcm(-2) was achieved for as-fabricated electrode. Also, the cotton electrode retains around 70% of specific capacitance after 3000 cycles at charge-discharge current density of 15 A g(-1). The slow decrease in specific capacitance is observed with increased discharge current density which proves its excellent rate capability. These results of rGO/MnO2/PANi/cotton fabric electrode show that this can be an excellent electrode for supercapacitor in energy storage devices.","[Etana, Bulcha Belay; Dhakshnamoorthy, M.; Demissie, Tamene Adugna] Jimma Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Jimma Inst Technol, POB 378, Jimma, Ethiopia; [Etana, Bulcha Belay; Ramakrishnan, Shanmugam; Dhakshnamoorthy, M.; Saravanan, S.; Ramamurthy, Praveen C.] Indian Inst Sci, Dept Mat Engn, Bangalore, Karnataka, India",Jimma University; Indian Institute of Science (IISC) - Bangalore,"Dhakshnamoorthy, M (corresponding author), Jimma Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Jimma Inst Technol, POB 378, Jimma, Ethiopia.;Dhakshnamoorthy, M; Ramamurthy, PC (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci, Dept Mat Engn, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.",dhakshnamoorthy.mani@ju.edu.et; praveen@iisc.ac.in,"Subramanian, Saravanan/KZQ-4646-2024; Etana, Bulcha/ABP-4550-2022; Mani, Dhakshnamoorthy/AAB-5043-2021; Ramamurthy, Praveen/HMD-6568-2023","Mani, Dhakshnamoorthy/0000-0002-1065-8346; Shanmugam, Dr Ramakrishnan/0000-0002-4084-4641; Etana, Bulcha Belay/0000-0002-4379-5494; Ramamurthy, Praveen/0000-0003-1880-5889",Jimma University,Jimma University,The authors thank Indian Institute of Science for providing laboratory facilities and Jimma University for providing financial support to carry out the research work in India.,,42.0,19,19,4,72,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",2053-1591,,,MATER RES EXPRESS,Mater.

The functionality of those materials comes at the expense of the degradation of their mechanical properties which are highly impacted by the rate distribution, shape and size of the porosity. Among them tetragonal stabilized zirconia (TSZ) is one of the most industrially used; it is sometime called: the ceramic steel since in its dense state it exhibits the high toughness for ceramics. It is known that the porosity has a huge impact on the thermo-mechanical properties refractory ceramics as Yittria Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ). This study aims to capitalize the mechanical properties as a function of porosity to provide future applications and ensure the behavior in service of thermal barrier coating. In the present paper, the correlation between the microstructure and the mechanical properties such as Young modulus, hardness and strength of YSZ ceramics obtained by Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) was investigated. Two types of YSZ powder, a nanometric one from Tosoh and a micrometric one obtained by sol-gel route were studied to prepare homogeneous mesoporous or oriented macroporous microstructure by partial sintering. SPS parameters have been determined and optimized to manage the porosity rate. Furthermore, a bimodal microstructure can be obtained, by mixing both powders, allowing the formation of linking bridges between the microporous zone and the nanopowder during sintering. The macroporous ceramics have lower Young modulus, hardness and strength than mesoporous ones. These characteristics are discussed in the paper taking into account the differences between microstructure and contacts between particles with various form factors. Thus, it is clearly evidenced that the morphology of raw powders and the level of porosity are key parameters to optimize the mechanical properties of such porous material.","[Fregeac, Arnaud; Ansart, Florence; Estournes, Claude] Univ Paul Sabatier, CNRS INPT Ups, CIRIMAT, Univ Toulouse, 118 Route Narbonne, F-31062 Toulouse 9, France; [Fregeac, Arnaud; Selezneff, Serge] SAFRAN Aircraft Engines, 2 Rue Henri Auguste Desbrueres, F-91100 Corbeil Essonnes, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Safran S.A.,"Estournès, C (corresponding author), Univ Paul Sabatier, CNRS INPT Ups, CIRIMAT, Univ Toulouse, 118 Route Narbonne, F-31062 Toulouse 9, France.",estournes@chimie.ups-tlse.fr,"Fregeac, Arnaud/JPL-0335-2023; ESTOURNES, Claude/F-2322-2017","ESTOURNES, Claude/0000-0001-8381-8454","Safran Aircraft Engines (Site de Corbeil, Evry, France); ANRT [2016/0781]","Safran Aircraft Engines (Site de Corbeil, Evry, France); ANRT(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR))","We would like to thank Safran Aircraft Engines (Site de Corbeil, Evry, France) and also the ANRT (no 2016/0781) for the financial support.",,59.0,19,19,1,69,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0272-8842,1873-3956,,CERAM INT,Ceram.

To investigate the failure modes and improve the blast resistances of masonry walls, four full-scale field tests were conducted using unreinforced and spray-on polyurea-reinforced masonry walls subjected to gas explosions. The results suggested that the primary damage of the unreinforced masonry wall was flexural deformation and the wall collapsed at the latter stage of gas explosion. The presence of polyurea coatings could effectively improve the anti-explosion abilities of masonry walls, prevent wall collapses, and retain the flying fragments, which would reduce the casualties and economic losses caused by petrochemical explosion accidents. The bond between the polymer and masonry wall was critical, and premature debonding resulted in a failure of the coating to exert the maximum energy absorption effect. A numerical model for masonry walls was developed in ANSYS/LS-Dyna and validated with the test data. Parametric studies were conducted to explore the influences of the polyurea-coating thickness and spray pattern on the performances of masonry walls.

The as-sprayed CoMoCrSi coatings were found to be predominantly composed of intermetallic Laves phases, i.e., Co7Mo6, Co3Mo2Si, Cr3Si, and some amorphous phases. The as-sprayed coatings possessed a compact and typical lamellar microstructure and balanced mechanical property; their Vickers hardness decreased from 855.9 +/- 16 HV5.0 at RT to 583.9 +/- 10 HV5.0 at 800 degrees C due to a normal soft phenomenon of material in hot environment. Further, between room temperature and 400 degrees C, the as-sprayed coatings suffered serious mechanical wear without any lubricant tribolayer forming on the worn surface, indicating that they would not function as good anti-wear materials at low temperatures. In particular, the coatings exhibited a brittle fracture coupled with abrasive wear at RT, obvious abrasive wear at 200 degrees C, and severe adhesive wear at 400 degrees C that with the highest friction coefficient of 0.65 and wear rate of 35.79 x 10(-6) mm(3)/(N.m). As the test temperature increased to 600 and 800 degrees C, the friction coefficient of the coating decreased to 0.45 and 0.26, respectively, and the corresponding wear rates reached 0.135 x 10(-6) mm(3)/(N.m) and 0.288 x 10(-6) mm(3)/(N.m), with a difference of approximately two orders of magnitude between the low- and high-temperature wear rate. This result further confirmed that the as-sprayed coatings are a better choice of abrasion-resistant materials for high-temperature applications. After sliding tests at 800 degrees C, numerous metallic oxides i.e., Co3O4, MoO3, and bimetallic oxides such as CoMoO4 and Co2CrO4 of nanometer size (50-100 nm) were identified in the continuous protective layer formed on the worn surface. These oxides played an important role of lubrication and reduced direct contact between the coating and its counterpart during the sliding process, leading to a decrease in the friction coefficient and material loss. The main wear mechanisms of the coatings at this temperature range are slight adhesive wear coupled with abrasive wear.","[Guo, Hongjian; Yan, Pengxun; Wu, Zhiguo] Gansu Acad Sci, Inst Nanomat Applicat Technol, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Guo, Hongjian; Wang, Yijing; Hao, Enkang; An, Yulong; Chen, Jianmin; Zhou, Huidi] Chinese Acad Sci, Lanzhou Inst Chem Phys, State Key Lab Solid Lubricat, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Guo, Hongjian] Lanzhou City Univ, Sch Bailie Mech Engn, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China; [Li, Bo] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Mech Behav Mat, Xian 710049, Peoples R China","Gansu Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics, CAS; Lanzhou City University; Xi'an Jiaotong University","Guo, HJ; Yan, PX (corresponding author), Gansu Acad Sci, Inst Nanomat Applicat Technol, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.;Guo, HJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Lanzhou Inst Chem Phys, State Key Lab Solid Lubricat, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.;Guo, HJ (corresponding author), Lanzhou City Univ, Sch Bailie Mech Engn, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China.",873373667@qq.com; pxyan@lzu.edu.cn,,"wu, zhi guo/0000-0001-8758-785X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [51665026, 51805408]; 'Light of West China' talent program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Young Science and Technology Foundation of Gansu Province [1506RJYA058]; Young Science and Technology Foundation of Gansu Academy of Sciences [2019QN-07]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2019M663851, 2019M653597]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); 'Light of West China' talent program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Young Science and Technology Foundation of Gansu Province; Young Science and Technology Foundation of Gansu Academy of Sciences; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation),"The authors gratefully acknowledge the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.51665026, 51805408), the `Light of West China' talent program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Young Science and Technology Foundation of Gansu Province (Grant No. 1506RJYA058), the Young Science and Technology Foundation of Gansu Academy of Sciences (Grant No. 2019QN-07), and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No. 2019M663851, 2019M653597) for their financial support.

The Ni layers covering on tungsten carbide particles were controlled by the reagent type of complexing agent, stabilizing agent, and surfactant. When Trisodium citrate is used as a complexing agent, it has a well complexing effect on metal ions, but the other complexing agent is poor effect. Compared with ordinary electroless plating, it is not suitable to use stabilizers for high concentration electroless plating. When Polyvinyl Pyrrolidone is used as surfactant, a dense coating layer can be obtained and the coating surface is relatively smooth. Nickel-plated cast tungsten carbide powder as the main raw material, SLM prepared tungsten carbide-based composite materials with uniform microstructure distribution and high relative density.

FT-IR spectrum of the MWCNTs shows a peak at 1640 cm(-1) corresponding to the stretching mode of the C=C double bond which forms the framework of the carbon nanotube sidewall. The broad peak at 3430 cm 1 is due to O-H stretching vibration of hydroxyl groups and the peak at 1712 cm(-1) corresponds to the carboxylic (C=O) group attached to the carbon fiber. The peaks at 2927 cm(-1) and 2862 cm(-1) are assigned to C-H stretching vibration of epoxy produced at the defect sites of acid-oxidized carbon fiber surface. SEM image shows a better interface bonding between the fiber and the matrix of modified composites (MWCNTs-CF/Ep) than those of unmodified composite. The loss factor curve of CF-MWCNTs/Ep composites is the narrowest compared with neat epoxy and CF/Ep composites which evinces that the length distribution range of molecular chain segments in the matrix is the narrowest. From the dependence of the AC conductivity on temperature, we can see that sigma(AC) increases when temperature increases. The increase in electrical conductivity of the composites may be a result of the increased chain ordering due to annealing effect. The use of MWCNTs to modify the surface of carbon fiber resulted in a large amount of junctions among MWCNT causing an increase in the electrical and thermal conductivity by forming conducting paths in the matrix. The MWCNTs-CF/Ep composite shows better thermal stability than unmodified composites. The strong interaction between CF and MWCNTs can retard diffusion of small molecules from the resin matrix at high temperature and hence, result in the improved thermal stability of the modified CF/Ep composite.","[Kareem, Aseel A.; Rasheed, Hussein Kh.] Univ Baghdad, Dept Phys, Coll Sci, Baghdad, Iraq",University of Baghdad,"Kareem, AA (corresponding author), Univ Baghdad, Dept Phys, Coll Sci, Baghdad, Iraq.",aseelalobaedY@yahoo.com,"Kareem, Aseel/C-9531-2018; Rasheed, Hussein/J-5585-2019","Rasheed, Hussein/0000-0001-9410-748X; Kareem, Aseel Abdulameer/0000-0002-5564-1222",,,,,28.0,33,34,7,30,SCIENDO,WARSAW,"DE GRUYTER POLAND SP Z O O, BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR, 01-811 WARSAW, POLAND",2083-134X,,,MATER SCI-POLAND,Mater.

Following the sintering process, the specimens produced by P/M were characterized by optical microscope, Scanning electron microscope, XRD analyses, 2D profilometer, micro hardness and wear test. The porosity values of the samples decreased and the specific gravity and surface roughness increased depend on the increase in borosintering temperature and time. A coating layer, similar to the boride layer formed in the steels, was observed in the specimens sintered with boron. On the other hand, no coating layer was observed in the specimens sintered in Si medium but there was some increase in their surface hardness in a limited area. The boride layer formed on the surface as a result of boro-sintering process has a thickness of 120-150 mu m and hardness values of 1300-1500 HV. In this study, it has been proven that sintering and thermal treatment with boron carried out separately in the existing literature have a positive effect on mechanical and wear properties when they are carried out in a single step.","[Koc, Vahdettin] Adiyaman Univ, Mech & Met Technol, Vocat Sch Tech Sci, TR-02000 Adiyaman, Turkey",Adiyaman University,"Koç, V (corresponding author), Adiyaman Univ, Mech & Met Technol, Vocat Sch Tech Sci, TR-02000 Adiyaman, Turkey.",vkoc@adiyaman.edu.tr,,,,,,,19.0,7,7,0,5,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",,2053-1591,,MATER RES EXPRESS,Mater.

U.",,,Influence of the inclination angle of stiffeners on folding during superplastic forming of corrugated core panels,LETTERS ON MATERIALS,,,English,Article,,,,,,superplastic forming; corrugated core panel; folding; modeling,TITANIUM-ALLOYS,"Superplastic forming of thin sheet corrugated structures is of special interest in developing aircraft technologies of new generation. The manufacture of such structures includes pressure welding of a package of three sheet blanks, consisting of two outer skin sheets and one inner core blank. The stop-off coating is applied to the inner surfaces of the skin sheets before welding. During superplastic forming of the package, the skin sheets take the form of a die cavity, while the core sheet stretches between the skins to form stiffeners. One of the main problems in manufacturing three-layer structures is known to be the formation of folds on the outer surface of the skins. The paper reports on studies of the influence of the inclination angle of stiffeners on folding. The choice of skin sheets with a thickness exceeding the thickness of the core sheet by 2 - 3 times may prevent the formation of folds. However, when manufacturing the corrugated structures of variable cross-section, such as hollow fan blades of an aircraft engine, the recommended ratio may not always be implemented. Moreover, its performance is limited by the permissible weight of the blade. In the present study, finite element modeling of the process of superplastic forming of three-layer structures made of titanium sheet alloy VT6 (analog of Ti-6Al-4V) is done using ANSYS software. According to the simulation results, it was found that with an increase in the inclination angle of the ribs, the holding time under pressure should be increased.","[Kruglovu, A. A.; Mulyukov, R.

The air oxidation kinetics of wire arc sprayed samples was established on the basis of weight change values for 50 cycles at 900 degrees C. Each cycle consists of 1 h of heating, followed by 20 min of cooling in air. The erosion corrosion performance of samples was determined by exposing them to the super heater zone of coal fired boiler for 15 cycles at 750 degrees, where each cycle consists of 100 h of heating, followed by 1 h of air cooling. Then, the kinematics of erosion corrosion were established using thickness loss and weight change value of the exposed samples. The distinct characterization techniques (XRD, SEM and EDS) were utilized to examine the oxidized and eroded corroded products. Experimental results reveal that both the coated samples offered more oxidation and erosion corrosion resistance. However, Ni-20Cr coating on SA516 steel perform better than T-22 steel. The Ni-20Cr coated SA516 and T-22 steel reduced the weight gain by 99% and 90% respectively in laboratory environment. Moreover, the Ni-20Cr coating reduced the erosion corrosion rate of SA516 and T-22 steel by 98.04% and 88.23% respectively in terms of thickness loss. The higher resistance against erosion corrosion and oxidation is due to the development of Cr2O3 phase, higher micro hardness and less porosity of the coating.","[Kumar, Santosh; Handa, Amit] IKG Punjab Tech Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Kapurthala, Punjab, India; [Kumar, Santosh] Chandigarh Grp Coll, Dept Mech Engn, Mohali, Punjab, India; [Kumar, Manoj] Chandigarh Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Mohali, Punjab, India",I.

This superior apatite-forming ability of the cpTi specimens can be attributed to the dense, thick titania layers with higher rutile nanorod density on their surfaces.","[Liu, Xingzhu] Okayama Univ, Grad Sch Nat Sci & Technol, Biomat Lab, Okayama, Japan; [Yoshioka, Tomohiko; Hayakawa, Satoshi] Okayama Univ, Grad Sch Interdisciplinary Sci & Engn Hlth Syst, Biomat Lab, Okayama, Japan",Okayama University; Okayama University,"Hayakawa, S (corresponding author), Okayama Univ, Grad Sch Interdisciplinary Sci & Engn Hlth Syst, Biomat Lab, Kita Ku, 3-1-1 Tsushima, Okayama 7008530, Japan.",satoshi@cc.okayama-u.ac.jp,"HAYAKAWA, Satoshi/B-2104-2011","HAYAKAWA, Satoshi/0000-0002-1097-8614",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [24656386]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24656386] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This research was partially supported by Grant-in-Aid for Challenging Exploratory Reseach Grant Number 24656386; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [24656386],,27.0,2,2,0,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2187-0764,,,J ASIAN CERAM SOC,J.

We report the synthesis of ZnO and ZnO loaded graphene nanostructures at different pH values with exposed polar facets by a simple hydrothermal method. Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide is used as surfactant and the synthesis is carried out without the aid of high temperature and demonstrated to have a superior photocatalytic activity. We observed a reduction in band gap for graphene loaded ZnO samples. Further, a one-step spin coating method is used for the preparation of optically transparent and photoinduced superhydrophilic ZnO hybrid films. We investigated the effect of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide capping agent on crystal growth and morphology of as synthesised samples. An effective improvement in photocatalytic activity of the nanohybrid (similar to 100%) compared to pure ZnO (85%) is observed within 150 min. This can be attributed to the synergetic interaction of the components of the hybrid. Also, the hybrid samples coated on the glass substrate exhibits good transparency and superhydrophilicity upon UV irradiation. An unexpected transmittance as high as 84%-97% throughout most of the visible light region of the spectrum of the hybrid samples along with good photocatalytic efficiency and photoinduced superhydrophilicity makes the samples more suitable for self-cleaning applications.","[Louis, Jesna; John, Honey] Cochin Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Polymer Sci & Rubber Technol, Cochin 682022, Kerala, India; [Louis, Jesna; Kavitha, M.

Diamond-like carbon (DLC) thin films are promising for corrosion protection due to chemical inertness and low electrical conductivity. Nevertheless, the performance of these coating is highly sensitive to the presence of uncoated areas. These defects represent the primary way of substrate degradation in aggressive environments. An in situ optical microscopy coupled to an electrochemical activation was developed to reveal micrometric growth defects and observe that they were at the origin of corrosion. A square wave voltammetry was applied to increase the sensitivity of electrochemical techniques based on the detection of the dissolution of the bare metal surface triggered by the presence of uncoated spots. This method can be utilized to quantify defect density arising from vapor deposition processes.","[Maerten, Thibault; Jaoul, Cedric; Duport, Patrice; Le Niniven, Christophe; Tristant, Pascal] Univ Limoges, IRCER, UMR CNRS 7315, F-87068 Limoges, France; [Maerten, Thibault; Meunier, Frederic] Oerlikon Balzers Coating France, F-87068 Limoges, France; [Oltra, Roland] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Lab ICB, UMR CNRS 6303, F-21078 Dijon, France; [Jarry, Olivier] Oerlikon Balzers Coating Germany GmbH, D-51427 Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; [Jaoul, Cedric] Ctr Europeen Ceram, IRCER, 12 Rue Atlantis, F-87068 Limoges, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Chemistry (INC); Universite de Limoges; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Physics (INP); Universite de Technologie de Belfort-Montbeliard (UTBM); Universite de Bourgogne Europe,"Jaoul, C (corresponding author), Univ Limoges, IRCER, UMR CNRS 7315, F-87068 Limoges, France.;Jaoul, C (corresponding author), Ctr Europeen Ceram, IRCER, 12 Rue Atlantis, F-87068 Limoges, France.",thibault.maerten@oerlikon.com; cedric.jaoul@unilim.fr; roland.oltra@u-bourgogne.fr; patrice.duport@unilim.fr; christophe.le-niniven@unilim.fr; pascal.tristant@unilim.fr; frederic.meunier@oerlikon.com; olivier.jarry@oerlikon.com,"; Jaoul, Cedric/A-4216-2009","oltra, roland/0000-0002-5991-6908; Le Niniven, Christophe/0000-0002-4984-0022; TRISTANT, Pascal/0000-0002-9872-6445; Maerten, Thibault/0000-0003-3390-3946; Jaoul, Cedric/0000-0001-6108-1076",ANRT (Agence Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie),ANRT (Agence Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),This work was financially supported by ANRT (Agence Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie).,,22.0,5,5,1,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2311-5629,,C-J CARBON RES,C-J.

Annealing at 1025 degrees C forms thermally stable framework structures with large chromium carbides and borides. As a result, improved hardness and wear resistance of the coating are maintained when heated to 1000 degrees C. Stabilizing annealing also increases the frictional thermal resistance of the NiCrBSi coating. Under high-speed (3.1-9.3 m/s) sliding friction, when the surface layer temperature reaches about 500-1000 degrees C and higher, the wear resistance of the coating increases by 1.7- 3.0 times. The proposed approach to the formation of heat-resistant coatings is promising, in particular, for a hot deformation tool and other components of metallurgical equipment operating under high thermal and mechanical loads. Such products include crystallizer walls of continuous casting machines. For the walls, the development of laser cladding technology for wear-resistant composite coatings on copper alloys is relevant as an alternative to thermal spraying. The cladding of composite NiBSi-WC coatings of 0.6 and 1.6 mm thickness on a Cu-Cr-Zr bronze substrate heated to 200 - 250 degrees C with a diode laser is considered. The presence of boron causes the formation of the W(C, B) carboboride phase, whose hardness is higher than that of WC in the initial powder. Depending on the thickness of coatings and, accordingly, on the duration of heating and the subsequent cooling, the process of secondary carboborides precipitation from the solid solution can be suppressed (in the thin coating) or activated (in the thick coating). This leads to a higher wear resistance under friction sliding 1.6 mm thickness coating.","[Makarov, A., V; Korobov, Yu S.; Stepchenkov, A.

The microstructural characterization of selected alloys was performed before and after electrochemical tests, using scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersion spectroscopy, and x-ray diffraction. The surface roughness of the alloys was investigated by Profilometer. Surface characterization of the passive layer formed on the coated and uncoated Ni-Cr dental alloys in artificial saliva was studied using impedance spectroscopy measurement.

The brittle cracking criterion was applied to describe the bending fracture process of GYbZ coatings.

Among others, formation of uniform 3D heterojunctions based on the TiO2 nanotubes attracts attention since porous structure provides highly developed surface area whereas tubular shape ensures facilitated charge transport. Following that, we focus on the comparison of different electrochemical routes leading to the formation of Cu2O onto the titania nanotubes platform to improve energy harvesting. Proposed approach includes optimized potentiostatic and pulsed polarization of titania immersed in the basic electrolyte composed of Cu2+ ions stabilized by lactic acid. In this work, we demonstrate that at strictly selected deposition parameters, namely time, pulse width and cycle number, one can obtain titania nanotubes overgrown by Cu2O species uniformly distributed across the whole TiO2 layer as proved by secondary ion mass-spectrometry. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies indicated purely Cu(I) oxide formation for pulsed deposition route. The photoactivity of obtained materials was verified both under vis and UV-vis irradiation. Depending on the incident light spectrum, variation in photoactivity was observed that is directly related with the charges generation and their transport within the junction. The transient photocurrent measurements show strong photocurrent enhancement for Cu2O modified titania comparing to pristine support and satisfactory photostability under visible light without any protective coating.","[Molenda, Z.; Grochowska, K.; Cenian, A.; Siuzdak, K.] Polish Acad Sci, Ctr Plasma & Laser Engn, Szewalski Inst Fluid Flow Machinery, Fiszera 14 St, PL-80231 Gdansk, Poland; [Karczewski, J.] Gdansk Univ Technol, Fac Appl Phys & Math, Narutowicza 11-12 St, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland; [Ryl, J.; Darowicki, K.] Gdansk Univ Technol, Fac Chem, Narutowicza 11-12 St, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland; [Rysz, J.] Jagiellonian Univ, M Smoluchowski Inst Phys, Lojasiewicza 11 St, PL-30348 Krakow, Poland",Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Fluid-Flow Machinery of the Polish Academy of Sciences; Fahrenheit Universities; Gdansk University of Technology; Fahrenheit Universities; Gdansk University of Technology; Jagiellonian University,"Siuzdak, K (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Ctr Plasma & Laser Engn, Szewalski Inst Fluid Flow Machinery, Fiszera 14 St, PL-80231 Gdansk, Poland.",ksiuzdak@imp.gda.pl,"Darowicki, Kazimierz/L-8992-2019; Ryl, Jacek/J-9330-2019; Rysz, Jakub/F-1043-2012; Karczewski, Jakub/L-7326-2018; Molenda, Zuzanna/JOZ-1326-2023","Ryl, Jacek/0000-0002-0247-3851; Molenda, Zuzanna/0009-0000-6476-7460; Darowicki, Kazimierz/0000-0002-5457-5008; Siuzdak, Katarzyna/0000-0001-7434-6408",Polish National Science Centre [2017/26/E/ST5/00416],Polish National Science Centre,This work received financial support from the Polish National Science Centre: Grant No. 2017/26/E/ST5/00416.,,65.0,8,8,6,34,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",,2053-1591,,MATER RES EXPRESS,Mater.

Considering the extension of applications in nanotechnologies, nanocrystalline TiO2 is very promising for nanoscale components. In this work, nanocrystalline TiO2 thin films were successfully deposited on porous silicon (PSi) by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) technique at temperature of 550 degrees C for different periods of times: 5, 10 and 15 min. The objective was to optimize the physicochemical and optical properties of the TiO2/PSi films dedicated for photovoltaic application. The structural, morphological and optical properties of the elaborated TiO2/PSi samples were analyzed by means of x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX), atomic force microscopy (AFM), photoluminescence (PL) and UV-Visible absorption spectroscopy methods. The effect of deposition time on the microstructural properties which influences the optical characteristics of the obtained samples was also examined. The XRD analysis confirms the nanocrystalline structure of the deposited TiO2 composed only by anatase phase. The SEM characterization evidenced an increase in the TiO2 film thickness showing more uniform surfaces as the deposition time rises. Correspondingly, the surface roughness increases with the particle size and film thickness as indicated by AFM studies. The TiO2/PSi/Si sandwich structure evidenced by cross-sectional SEM confirms the good adherence of the TiO2 nanocrystalline film on the porous silicon forming with silicon a composite material. The UV-Vis measurements showed a considerable enhancement in optical absorption of porous silicon after the deposition of TiO2 films. Indeed, the TiO2 coatings deposited on PSi for 15 min with thickness of 200 nm have the best structure quality and exhibit, consequently, the highest absorption. From these interesting results, we demonstrate the viability of the use of the MOCVD as reproducible process for the elaboration of high-quality TiO2/PSi films.","[Oussidhoum, S.; Hocine, D.; Belkaid, M.

Here, we have used for the first time the ZnS compound as a zinc source in place of conventional ZnCl2 as its binding energy with other constituents is more. The results imply that high quality of CZTSSe film could be feasible by infusing selenium during annealing of the film in selenium atmosphere in the temperature range of 500 degrees C-520 degrees C. The formed film shows perfect kesterite structure with a balanced interplanar spacing at the above-mentioned environment. The one-step annealing with selenisation of the as-deposited film shows improved crystallite size, microstrain, and lattice parameters. From the compositional analysis results, the infusion of selenium on annealing at high temperature shows the decrease in Cu/(Zn + Sn) ratio and an increase in Zn/Sn ratio as compared to as-deposited films confirming the required stoichiometric ratio for photovoltaic applications. The SEM image confirms the formation of a compact regular surface when the film is subjected to the annealing process. The bandgap of the film was calculated from UV-vis spectrophotometer and there is an increase in conductivity and mobility of the annealed absorber layer is found from the Hall measurement system.","[Padhy, Srinibasa; Bal, Shriya Sakul; Singh, Udai P.] KIIT Deemed Be Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Thin Film Photovolta Lab, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India",Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT),"Singh, UP (corresponding author), KIIT Deemed Be Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Thin Film Photovolta Lab, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India.",singhup@kiit.ac.in,"Singh, Udai/E-8914-2013","SINGH, UDAI/0000-0002-5910-5275; padhy, srinibasa/0000-0003-2267-3743","DST_SERB, New Delhi","DST_SERB, New Delhi","This work is supported by DST_SERB, New Delhi under grantEMR/2017/002196 andMNRENew Delhi 31/13/2013-14/PVSE-R&D.",,19.0,2,2,2,14,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",2053-1591,,,MATER RES EXPRESS,Mater.

This surface modification is intended to improve oxide bioceramic's ability to integrate with the biological environment and, in particular, to rapidly osteointegrate. In this study, the surface of zirconia-toughened alumina (ZTA) was functionalized using two methods: (i) Surface laser-patterning and successive filling of patterned wells with powder mixtures of bioglass and Si3N4; and, (ii) Si3N4 coating by pulse-laser sintering. Functionalized ZTA surfaces were characterized with vibrational spectroscopy, biological testing, and laser microscopy. Both enhancements resulted in osteoblast activation, a property that is relevant to osteosynthesis.","[Pezzotti, Giuseppe; Marin, Elia; Zanocco, Matteo; Boschetto, Francesco; Zhu, Wenliang] Kyoto Inst Technol, Ceram Phys Lab, Sakyo Ku, Matsugasaki, Kyoto 6068585, Japan; [Pezzotti, Giuseppe; Zanocco, Matteo; Boschetto, Francesco; Mazda, Osam] Kyoto Prefectural Univ Med, Grad Sch Med Sci, Dept Immunol, Kamigyo Ku, 465 Kajii Cho, Kyoto 6028566, Japan; [Pezzotti, Giuseppe] Tokyo Med Univ, Dept Orthoped Surg, Shinjuku Ku, 6-7-1 Nishi Shinjuku, Tokyo 1600023, Japan; [Pezzotti, Giuseppe] Osaka Univ, Ctr Adv Med Engn & Informat, 2-2 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650854, Japan; [Marin, Elia; Adachi, Tetsuya; Yamamoto, Toshiro; Kanamura, Narisato] Kyoto Prefectural Univ Med, Grad Sch Med Sci, Dept Dent Med, Kamigyo Ku, Kyoto 6028566, Japan; [McEntire, Bryan J.; Bal, B.

The resultant samples were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for morphology assessment, energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for elemental analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD) for the assessment of crystal phase identification, and Raman spectroscopy for the confirmation of the presence of the incorporated SWCNTs. The Cu-SWCNT composites were found to contain carbon, catalytic iron (associated with the raw, as-received SWCNTs), oxygen, and copper; the latter was found to be inversely proportional to carbon and iron contents. The oxygen (associated with both the SWCNT defect sites and oxidized copper surfaces) remained more or less constant regardless of the proportion of SWCNTs in the composites. The Raman I-G:I-D ratio remains within the experimental error constant, indicating that the electroless deposition does not have a deleterious effect on the SWCNTs. At short deposition times, SEM revealed a relatively dense structure comprising a distinctive fibrous morphology, suggestive of an underlying SWCNT substrate coated with copper; however, with increasing deposition, a more porous morphology is observed. The size of the granular particles increases up until 10 min of reaction, after which time it remains unchanged.","[Raja, Pavan M., V; Esquenazi, Gibran L.; Brinson, Bruce E.; Wright, Kourtney; Barron, Andrew R.] Rice Univ, Dept Chem, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Jones, Daniel R.; Gowenlock, Cathren E.; Barron, Andrew R.] Swansea Univ, Energy Safety Res Inst, Bay Campus, Swansea SA1 8EN, W Glam, Wales; [Li, Jianhua] Rice Univ, Shared Equipment Author, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Barron, Andrew R.] Rice Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Nanoengn, Houston, TX 77005 USA",Rice University; Swansea University; Rice University; Rice University,"Barron, AR (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Chem, Houston, TX 77005 USA.;Gowenlock, CE; Barron, AR (corresponding author), Swansea Univ, Energy Safety Res Inst, Bay Campus, Swansea SA1 8EN, W Glam, Wales.;Barron, AR (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Nanoengn, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",vr15@rice.edu; gibranesquenazi@gmail.com; d.r.jones@swansea.ac.uk; Jianhua.Li@rice.edu; brinson@rice.edu; kourtney.d.wright@lmco.com; c.gowenlock@swansea.ac.uk; a.r.barron@swansea.ac.uk,,,Office of Naval Research [N00014-15-2717]; Ser Cymru II Welsh Fellowship; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF); Welsh European Funding Office (WEFO) through the Welsh Government,Office of Naval Research(United States Department of DefenseUnited States NavyOffice of Naval Research); Ser Cymru II Welsh Fellowship; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)(European Union (EU)); Welsh European Funding Office (WEFO) through the Welsh Government,"Funding for this work was provided by the Office of Naval Research (N00014-15-2717), a Ser Cymru II Welsh Fellowship (C.E.G.), part funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), and Flexible Integrated Energy Systems (FLEXIS) operations funded by the Welsh European Funding Office (WEFO) through the Welsh Government (A.R.B.).",,40.0,1,1,0,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2311-5629,,C-J CARBON RES,C-J.

Scanning electron microscope (SEM), equipped with an energy dispersive spectroscope (EDS) and optical microscope (OM), was used to study the morphology and the chemical compositions of the coatings. Corrosion behavior of the coatings was studied via electrochemical impedance spectrometry (EIS) and linear polarization tests in a 3.5 wt% NaCl solution at ambient temperature. Micro hardness of the coatings was also studied via a micro hardness tester. According to the results, phosphorous content of the coatings was decreased from 17.5 wt% to 11.5 wt% as the amount of alumina nano-particles increased in the plating bath. Similarly, micro crack density of the coatings was also decreased. Also, composite coatings revealed higher corrosion resistance and micro hardness. Corrosion current density was decreased from 2 mu A cm(-2) to 0.2 mu A cm(-2) and hardness of the coatings was increased from 600 HV to 930 HV, as the composition of the coating was converted from pure Cr-P alloy coating to Cr-P/nano Al2O3 composite coating.","[Ramezani-Varzaneh, H.

EP loading resulted in storage capacity of 5221.86 mu g cm(-2) for TNT-80 which was much higher than 1036.75 mu g cm(-2) of immersed sample. Drug release comprised of three stages: (i) burst release (78% for the bare, and 23% for the TNT-80 sample), (ii) gradual transport (21% for the bare, and 64% for the TNT-80 sample), and (iii) equilibrium. Transfer from all electrophoretically loaded TNT samples obeyed semi-infinite diffusion mechanism with a diffusion coefficient of 1.5 x 10(-15) cm(2) s(-1).

ANd:YAG laser (532 nm) based pulsed laser deposition system has been used for this work. Post deposition, surface morphology, and chemical composition of the obtained films on Ti-alloy surface have been examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDX). In vitro bioactivity of these PLD coated Ti-alloy samples was evaluated by immersing the BG coated Ti-alloy samples in simulated body fluid (SBF) for 10 days. SBF immersed samples have been analyzed using SEM, EDX, and micro Raman spectroscopic techniques. Superior growth of bone like apatite i.e. hydroxyapatite (HAP) have been observed on such BG coated Ti-alloy samples in comparison to uncoated Ti-alloy in our investigations. Also, biocompatibility tests carried out by us measuring tolerance of U2OS osteosarcoma cells to these PLD coated Ti6Al4V samples have shown positive results.","[Shaikh, Shazia; Kedia, Sunita; Sinha, Sucharita] Bhabha Atom Res Ctr, Laser & Plasma Surface Proc Sect, Mumbai 400085, Maharashtra, India; [Shaikh, Shazia; Sinha, Sucharita] Univ Mumbai, Mumbai 400001, Maharashtra, India; [Majumdar, Ananda Guha; Subramanian, Mahesh] Bhabha Atom Res Ctr, Bioorgan Div, Mumbai 400085, Maharashtra, India; [Subramanian, Mahesh; Sinha, Sucharita] Homi Bhabha Natl Inst, Training Sch Complex, Mumbai 400094, Maharashtra, India",Bhabha Atomic Research Center (BARC); University of Mumbai; Bhabha Atomic Research Center (BARC); Homi Bhabha National Institute,"Kedia, S (corresponding author), Bhabha Atom Res Ctr, Laser & Plasma Surface Proc Sect, Mumbai 400085, Maharashtra, India.",skedia@barc.gov.in,"Shaikh, Shazia/HSG-7870-2023","GUHA MAJUMDAR, ANANDA/0000-0002-5025-758X; shaikh, shazia/0000-0002-9265-3505",,,,,25.0,13,13,1,9,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",2053-1591,,,MATER RES EXPRESS,Mater.

Pure Sn coatings were prepared from a plating electrolyte composed of sodium stannate, sodium hydroxide, and sorbitol as an additive. The bath pH was changed from 9 to 14 and the plating current density was varied from 5-25 mA cm(-2). The solderability of the Sn platings was estimated by spread ratio measurement according to JIS-Z-3197 standard. The obtained coatings were polycrystalline having a tetragonal beta-Sn structure. The deposits were spongy and porous at pH approximate to 9-10. As the bath pH was increased from 11-13, the film growth improved, the best crystallinity of film was obtained at pH 13 and a current density of 15-20 mA cm(-2). The coatings possess optimum microhardness and spreadability at a current density of 15 mA cm(-2) and bath pH similar to 12-13. It is shown that the optimization of current density and bath pH is necessary for the better strength and solderability of Sn coatings when alkaline baths are employed.","[Sharma, Ashutosh; Ahn, Byungmin] Ajou Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Suwon 16499, South Korea; Ajou Univ, Dept Energy Syst Res, Suwon 16499, South Korea",Ajou University; Ajou University,"Ahn, B (corresponding author), Ajou Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Suwon 16499, South Korea.",byungmin@ajou.ac.kr,"Sharma, Ashutosh/X-1773-2019; Ahn, Byungmin/B-3845-2010; Sharma, Ashutosh/G-6242-2015","Ahn, Byungmin/0000-0002-0866-6398; Sharma, Ashutosh/0000-0003-0413-4623","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [NRF-2018R1D1A1B07044706, NRF-2018R1D1A1B07044481]",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education,This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (NRF-2018R1D1A1B07044481) (BA).

Cross-sectional analysis of composite coating suggested formation of lamellar structure with good splat/splat bonding as well as with the substrate material. Both microhardness and slurry erosion resistance of Inconel 718/20% cBN coating was found to be significantly higher than that of uncoated and other composite coatings. For all slurry erosion test conditions the composite coatings were found to be superior to that of uncoated substrate.

Five kinds of SiC fibers, four kinds of SiC matrices, and three kinds of fiber/matrix interphase materials were examined in autoclaves. The potential constituent materials for future use in SiC/SiC composites were selected by considering corrosion rates and residual strength characteristics. The mass changes and the residual strength of each specimen were measured. SEM images of the surface layers were also inspected. The SiC fibers, regardless of their purity, crystallinity or stoichiometric ratio, decreased in strength due to the hydrothermal corrosion. For its part, the hydrothermal corrosion resistance of CVD-SiC, as a SiC matrix, was found to be affected by manufacturing conditions such as raw material gas type and synthesis temperature, as well as post-machining morphology. The CVD-carbon (CVD-C), as a fiber/matrix interphase material, showed good hydrothermal corrosion resistance. In order to protect the SiC fibers and the SiC matrices from hydrothermal corrosion, it would appear to be necessary to apply a dense CVD-C coating to both every fiber and the entire surface of the SiC matrices.","[Suyama, Shoko; Ukai, Masaru; Akimoto, Megumi; Nishimura, Toshiki; Tajima, Satoko] Toshiba Energy Syst & Solut Corp, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan",Toshiba Energy Systems & Solutions Corporation,"Suyama, S (corresponding author), Toshiba Energy Syst & Solut Corp, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan.",shoko.suyama@toshiba.co.jp; masaru.ukai@toshiba.co.jp; megumi.akimoto@toshiba.co.jp; toshiki1.nishimura@toshiba.co.jp; satoko.tajima@toshiba.co.jp,,,,,,,26.0,3,3,0,17,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2571-6131,,,CERAMICS-BASEL,Ceramics-Switzerland,DEC,2019,2.0,4,,,,,602.0,611,,10.3390/ceramics2040047,0.0,,,10.0,"Materials Science, Ceramics; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Materials Science,WF7NC,,gold,,,2025-04-23,WOS:000706487800001,0,

However, this layer is the main failure of TBC and, thus, required further research. This work studied the initial growth of the TGO when exposed to NiCrAlY (BC) at high temperatures. The NiCrAlY samples obtained from its powder by isostatic pressing, sintered by hot uniaxial pressing at 1150 degrees C for one hour (10 MPa), and the TGO was grown by heat treatment in the air and vacuum at 800, 1100, and 1150 degrees C for four hours. The results indicated that with increased temperature, surface roughness increases and the oxide layers in the vacuum process are larger than in the air.

The as-sprayed and post-processed coatings were characterised in terms of their microstructure, microhardness, fracture toughness and surface roughness. Pin-on-disc tribometer was used to analyse the abrasive wear behaviour of as-sprayed and post-processed coatings.

The basic metal alloy powder is made with Mechanical alloying technique. Controlled variables Number of layers (2, 3 and 5), particulate size (25 mu m and 50 mu m), Load (10 N, 20 Nand 30 N), track diameter (60 mm, 80 mm 100 mm), and the speed of the disc (500, 750 and 1000 rpm) are selected to conduct dry sliding wear test using pin on disc apparatus. Experiments are design using Taguchi's L36 orthogonal array. Optimization of parameters is done using Signal-to-Noise ratio. For the wear rate smaller-the-better criteria is used for analyzing the results. Analysis of Variance is done using Minitab software to find the most significant variables for the wear rate. From the results it is concluded that particle condition with 31.49% contribution, number of layers with 30.61% and speed of the disc with 10.36% contribution are the most significant factors. Linear regression equation is developed and conducted confirmation test. From the comparison a 13.5% error is observed between predicted value and actual value.

The effects of different laser power and Co content on the microstructure and properties of the cladding layer were studied. The results showed that when the laser power was too low, there were unmelted WC-Co powders on the surface of the cladding layer. In contrast, when the laser power was too high, the coating materials were prone to over-burning and evaporation, cracks and pores were aggravated. The WC-25Co coatings without cracks and pores could be formed when power is set at 1300 W, and its average micro-hardness was higher than other specimens. The addition of Co was helpful to the bonding of clad and Ti-6Al-4V substrate. New hard phases of TiC and CoTi2 were mainly distributed in the cladding coatings. The micro-hardness of the cladding coatings increased by 2-4 times than that of the Ti-6Al-4V substrate, and the maximum hardness reached 1349 HV.

The highest C-G can reach 0.181 mg ml(-1), while the smallest I-D/I-G is only 0.331 in the investigated range. Meanwhile, we observed that C-G and I-D/I-G changed in the opposite trend with the increase of SAS concentration, and reached their extreme values simultaneously. This was attributed to SAS's agglomeration-induced redistribution of total energy absorbed by graphite between exfoliation and crushing. The graphene size was mainly within 100-400 nm and most of layer number was <5. The stabilization of graphene dispersion comes from the electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged SAS groups adsorbed on the graphene sheets. As the protective coating of aluminium, the graphene with relative small (for H2SO4 solution) or large (for NaCl solution) size, relative high defect content and annealing at proper temperature can improve the anticorrosion performance of graphene.","[Yang, Shengkai; Zhuo, Kelei; Zhang, Zezhong; Yang, Jingli; Chen, Yujuan; Wang, Jianji] Henan Normal Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Henan Prov Green Mfg Fine, Key Lab Green Chem Media & React, Minist Educ,Sch Chem & Chem Engn, Xinxiang 453007, Henan, Peoples R China",Henan Normal University,"Zhuo, KL; Wang, JJ (corresponding author), Henan Normal Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Henan Prov Green Mfg Fine, Key Lab Green Chem Media & React, Minist Educ,Sch Chem & Chem Engn, Xinxiang 453007, Henan, Peoples R China.",klzhuo@263.net; jwang@htu.edu.cn,"Wang, Jianji/IYJ-0810-2023; Zhuo, Kelei/HKF-2933-2023","Wang, Jianji/0000-0003-2417-4630; Zhuo, Kelei/0000-0002-8773-8694","National Natural Science Foundation of China [21573058, 21873026]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 21573058 and 21873026).,,50.0,2,2,1,17,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",2053-1591,,,MATER RES EXPRESS,Mater.

The microstructure and composition of Co-WC composite coating were investigated by scanning electron microscopy equipped with an energy dispersive x-ray spectroscope. The adhesion strength of Co-WC composite coating was evaluated by WS-2005 automatic scratch tester. Results revealed that WC particles were homogeneously embedded in the Co matrix with few defects, and the Co-WC composite coating was firmly bonded to the HSS substrate. The optimized parameters are as follows: WC concentration of 35 g l(-1), current density of 6.5 A dm(-2), stirring rate of 300 rpm, and pH of 7.5 and temperature of 50 degrees C. X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that the Co matrix combined physically with the WC particles. Also, the microindentation hardness of Co-WC composite coating was tested by micro-hardness tester.

To improve the performance of this NCM811 material, Al2O3, ZrO2, and LBO (Li2O-2B(2)O(3)) are, respectively, used to coat it by a wet chemical method. The effects of Al2O3, ZrO2, and LBO thin coating layers (20-200 nm) on the morphology, structure and electrochemical property of NCM811 are studied using XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, and electrochemical measurements. Coin LIBs are assembled with the uncoated, Al2O3-coated, ZrO2-coated, and LBO-coated NCM811 cathode materials for performance validation. The experiment results confirm that the charge-discharge specific capacity, Coulomb efficiency, water absorption stability, cycle characteristics, and resistance stability of the NCM811 cathode material can be significantly improved by coating it with LBO particularly.

Biofilms can then form on the implants, which can enhance the chance of inducing peri-implantitis to result in the failure of implantation. Grafting of anti-biofouling polymer brushes on the implants is a promising method to prevent the above issues. However, degrafting problems of polymer brushes might inhibit durable applications. Herein, we present the fabrication of poly(3-sulfopropyl methacrylate potassium) (PSPMAK) brushes on silicon substrates through multiple single bonds, abbreviated as (M-PSPMAK). These brushes display an enhanced stability, and can remain attached in aqueosus solutions for at least 32 days with less than 10% chain degrafting. The brush-coated surfaces exhibit excellent anti-biofouling behavior against bacteria, while mammalian cells can attach on the surface freely to promote implant interaction with healthy tissues. The stable brushes can also effectively inhibit the formation of a bacterial biofilm. As a proof of principle, we mimicked the implantation process by implanting M-PSPMAK brushes coated silicon in rats. The animal experiments indicate that the brush displays a good anti-biofouling behavior by resisting bacterial attachment. The above results indicate that M-PSPMAK brushes with enhanced stability have great potential to be applied as long-term anti-biofouling coating on artificial implants to reduce the chance of bacterial infection in clinic.","[Yu, Yunlong; Li, Pengfei; Ding, Zhichao; Yin, Yue; Yuan, Yucheng; Zhang, Shiyong] Sichuan Univ, Natl Engn Res Ctr Biomat, 29 Wangjiang Rd, Chengdu 610064, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Cirelli, Marco; de Beer, Sissi; Vancso, G.

The chemical bonding structure and composition of the DLC coatings were confirmed by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The micromorphology and surface roughness of the DLC were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The element compositions of cross section were determined by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). The interfacial contact resistance (ICR) was measured. Furthermore, the DLC-coated SUS316L steel was corroded by potentiostatic polarizations in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution at 0.8 V, 90 degrees C for 168 h, and the corrosion behaviors were investigated in the solution using electrochemical techniques. In addition, the metal ions in sulfuric acid corrosion solution were detected by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy. The results indicate that the DLC coatings deposited at a lower gas ratio CH4/H-2 of 1 : 1 could result in a decreasing ID/IG ratio of 1.03, low Ra roughness of 3.77 nm, low ICR of 12.9 m omega cm(2), and low metal ion concentration of 16.60 ppm in the corrosion solution. The significant improvement in the anticorrosion resistance of the DLC film was mainly due to the increased sp(3) element and formation of the passive film. As a result, the DLC coating deposited on the SUS316L steel at CH4/H-2 = 1 : 1 has better anticorrosion properties. However, the DLC film-coated SUS316L steel still cannot meet the corrosive resistance of the bipolar plate.","[Han, Bei B.] Saitama Inst Technol, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Elect Engn, Fusaiji 1690, Saitama 3690293, Japan; [Ju, Dong Y.; Chai, Mao R.] Saitama Inst Technol, Dept Adv Sci Inst, Fusaiji 1690, Saitama 3690293, Japan; [Ju, Dong Y.; Zhao, Hui J.] Hangzhou Dianzi Univ, 1,2nd St Jianggan Dist, Hangzhou 310000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Ju, Dong Y.] Ningbo Inst Mat Ind Innovat, 12,Lane 689,Changxing Rd, Ningbo 315000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Chai, Mao R.] State Power Investment Corp, Bldg 3,28 Financial St, Beijing 100000, Peoples R China; [Sato, Susumu] Saitama Inst Technol, Dept Informat Syst, Fusaiji 1690, Saitama 3690293, Japan",Saitama Institute Technology; Saitama Institute Technology; Hangzhou Dianzi University; State Power Investment Corporation; Saitama Institute Technology,"Ju, DY (corresponding author), Saitama Inst Technol, Dept Adv Sci Inst, Fusaiji 1690, Saitama 3690293, Japan.;Ju, DY (corresponding author), Hangzhou Dianzi Univ, 1,2nd St Jianggan Dist, Hangzhou 310000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.;Ju, DY (corresponding author), Ningbo Inst Mat Ind Innovat, 12,Lane 689,Changxing Rd, Ningbo 315000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",dyju@sit.ac.jp,"HAN, Bei/JDX-1508-2023","Zhao, Huijun/0000-0002-2737-2416",State Power Investment Corporation; Ningbo Institute of Materials Industry Innovation in China,State Power Investment Corporation; Ningbo Institute of Materials Industry Innovation in China,This research was funded by State Power Investment Corporation and the Ningbo Institute of Materials Industry Innovation in China.,,37.0,14,16,4,40,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1687-8434,1687-8442,,ADV MATER SCI ENG,Adv.

The static (static polymer-polymer correlation length (mesh size), associates of cross-links and PVP microchains) and dynamic (polymer chain relaxation rate, hydrodynamic polymer-polymer correlation length) structural elements were determined. The incorporation of titania nanoparticles into PVP hydrogel slightly increases the size of structural inhomogeneities (an increase in the static and dynamic polymer-polymer correlation length, the formation of associates of cross-links and PVP chains). Titania nanoparticles have an impact on the microstructure of the composite hydrogel and form associates with sizes from 0.5 to 2 mu m attached to PVP hydrogel pore walls. The PVP and TN/PVP hydrogels show a high degree of water swelling. Moreover, the presence of titania nanoparticles in TN/PVP increases the number of water adsorption cycles compared to PVP hydrogel.

Highly demanding conditions are to carry out the process under inert gas, at a low temperature, and without aggressive chemicals to avoid damages to the organic materials. Here we show for the first time a solution-processed TFE to totally equal the level of conventional glass-cap encapsulation to achieve a ready-to-be-used stability of an organic light emitting diode (OLED). A seamless organic/inorganic multilayer in a structure such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)/SiOx/SiNy/SiOxNy with a built-in compositional gradient, as we named PONT, was achieved by a combination of two Si-based polymer coatings, UV-curable PDMS, perhydropolysilazane (PHPS), and their photochemical conversion under irradiation of vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) light (lambda = 172 nm) in an N-2-filled glovebox at room temperature. PDMS precursors diluted with decamethylcyclopentasiloxane were directly coated to OLED to form a protective layer. The presence of soft, elastic PDMS and its surface conversion to SiOx to improve wetting resulted in strong adhesion at the interfaces and relaxed strain to avoid cracks in ultrathin and high density SiOxNy to serve as a perfect barrier. A remarkably low water vapor transmission rate <10(-4) g/m(2)/day was confirmed for a single PONT as thin as 280 nm. Standardized OLED devices with PONT TFEs have proven 3,864 and 528 h stability under atmospheric (25 degrees C, 50% relative humidity (RH)) and accelerated (60 degrees C, 90%RH) degradation tests, respectively, without formation of nonemissive dark spots in OLEDs. The fast processing of PONT TFE can be applied to roll-to-roll fabrication of various organic devices at low cost and in large areas, since direct solution coating as well as VUV irradiation do not cause any noticeable damages to sensitive organic materials.","[Sun, Lina; Suzuri, Yoshiyuki] Yamagata Univ, Innovat Ctr Organ Elect INOEL, Arcadia 1-808-48, Yonezawa, Yamagata 9920119, Japan; [Uemura, Kaho; Takahashi, Tatsuhiro; Yoshida, Tsukasa] Yamagata Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Jonan 4-3-16, Yonezawa, Yamagata 9928510, Japan",Yamagata University; Yamagata University,"Sun, L; Suzuri, Y (corresponding author), Yamagata Univ, Innovat Ctr Organ Elect INOEL, Arcadia 1-808-48, Yonezawa, Yamagata 9920119, Japan.",sunlina@yz.yamagata-u.ac.jp; suzuri@yz.yamagata-u.ac.jp,"Suzuri, Yoshiyuki/AAU-4137-2020","YOSHIDA, LINA/0000-0002-1909-8066; Yoshida, Tsukasa/0000-0003-0754-445X; Takahashi, Tatsuhiro/0000-0001-9291-6136; Suzuri, Yoshiyuki/0000-0002-5254-8735","JST COI, Japan [JPMJCE1312]; Gender Equality Program of Yamagata University","JST COI, Japan; Gender Equality Program of Yamagata University","This work was financially supported by JST COI grant number JPMJCE1312, Japan and the Gender Equality Program of Yamagata University.

The necessary mechanical strength of the layer should arise from its 3D structure and inorganic-organic nanocomposite character. The self-organized NT layer is obtained via potentiostatic anodization of NiTi alloy sheets. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements show that the anodization process barely affects the transformation behavior of NiTi. Structural characterization reveals that the NT layer mainly consists of TiO2 after heat treatment at temperatures >= 450 degrees C. The functionalization of the NT layer is conducted via the photografting of a biocompatible, anti-adhesive zwitterionic polymer using soft UV light. The polymer layer is shown to cover the surface and the nanotube walls. Further, the high adhesion and mechanical strength of the functionalized anodic films together with their in vitro biocompatibility are demonstrated. Samples structured in functionalized and non-functionalized stripes show that the functionalized stripes are endowed with a high resistance to protein and bacteria adhesion. The results show that with the proposed surface design the aims set are attained. (C) 2019 The Authors.

In this study, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) was firstly introduced into the polymer insulating filler (Polyphenylene ether resin, PPER) of copper clad laminates for high frequency applications. The as-obtained CCLs exhibited a high thermal conductivity up to 1 W/m.K and a low dielectric loss of similar to 4 x 10(-3). Meanwhile, the interface tailoring of hBN was also tried by SiO2 coating, which enhanced the peel strength to a maximum value of 1.1 N/mm, but changed the thermal conductivity behavior of the CCLs from the Agari's linear model to the modified quadratic model due to the interfacial thermal resistance effect of SiO2 coating on hBN. Moreover, the flexural strength and water absorption were also tested. The results revealed that, comparing with the related composite materials reported in literature and commercial products, the CCLs obtained in this paper have outstanding advantages in thermal and dielectric properties, validating the high potential of the present CCLs for use in high frequency PCBs.

Three model epoxy systems with low, medium, and high crosslinking densities were prepared to systematically investigate how the scratch behavior might be influenced. The effect of crosslinking density on the onset of groove, crack and plowing formation during scratching was investigated. Coefficient of friction measurements, uniaxial tensile and compressive stress-strain curves, and dynamic mechanical analyses were conducted to correlate the intrinsic material properties to the observed scratch-induced deformation of the model epoxy systems. The findings indicate that the scratch behavior of epoxy resins can be directly correlated to their material properties. It is found that both the tensile strength and compressive yield stress determine the resistance against damage formation during scratch. Additionally, a comparison between pencil hardness and scratch test is presented to assess the suitability of both methods for evaluating scratch performance of polymers with significantly different mechanical properties.

The powders were experimentally characterised to determine the effect of the morphology, size, and levels of reinforcement on the powder flowability. The powder was developed via the powder metallurgy route and the effect of material, process conditions and various levels of reinforcement were investigated through the microhardness of the sintered samples. Sintered samples produced from the 316L + SiC + PVA powder mixes presented improved hardness. Analysis of the Energy Dispersive X-ray measurements detected high intensity levels of carbon and silicon on the surface of the reinforced 316L partides. In terms of measured powder rheology, the 6 wt% SiC coated 3161 provided the highest flowability of the prepared SiC coated 316L powders and a much higher flowability than the as received 3161 powder. All prepared SiC coated 316L powders showed good flowability and highly repeatable powder rheology. The high degree of flowability was attributed to the particle spherical morphology, the narrow range of particle size distribution and also the coating of nano SiC particles on the 316L particles which were found to act in this case as a solid lubricant. A successful homogeneous and uniform reinforcement of SiC onto the surface particles was resultant from the established mixing technique. While the nano-SIC improved the powder fluidity, the obtained improvement in hardness was also due to the nano-SiC dissolution and resultant precipitates formed during the thermal treatment (C) 2019 The Authors.

However, the trade-off between improving luminous transmittance (T-lum) and maintaining the near-infrared modulation ability (Delta T-NIR) limits the commercialization of VO2-based smart windows. To overcome these restrictions, we manufactured nanoinks based on VO2 nanoparticles and fabricated films via spin-coating these inks on quartz substrates. In this study, a simple photolithography method is employed to produce micropatterned VO2 films with different periodicities. The dried VO2 films were sintered by thermal and intense pulsed light (IPL) sintering processes. These micropatterned structures could favorably transmit visible light without sacrificing high Delta T-NIR , and the patterned films showed improved T-lum compared to continuous films. The patterned VO2 films thermally sintered at 400 degrees C have T-lum of 51.5%-58.8%, Delta(NIR) of 19.5%-27.6%, and Delta T-sol of 5.7%-8.0%. The patterned VO2 films IPL-sintered at 2000 V have T-lum of 42.7%-50.7%, Delta T-NIR of 21.7%-26.9%, and Delta T-sol of 6.1%-7.6%. This facile fabrication method offers a new and promising direction for the use of VO2 thermochromic materials in smart window applications.

The oriented dendrite growth and phase distribution of the remelted bead were characterized by electron backscatter diffraction, which indicated that the center of this local site consisted of parallel columnar grains. A face-centered cubic phase (FCC) and body-centered cubic phase (BCC) existed in the fusion zone. Under solidification shrinkage, the columnar dendrites detached from each other, which yielded the necessary strain factor to generate solidification cracks. Because of the different dilution rates for different parameters, the laser-remelted zone presented three solidification modes (including the full FCC mode, the FCC-BCC mode and the BCC-FCC mode) for different process parameters, which presents different cracking sensibilities. The samples that were solidified in the full FCC and BCC-FCC mode presented no cracks in the fusion zone. The laser-remelted bead exhibited cracking only for the FCC-BCC solidification mode under a specific composition. The phase-diagram calculation showed that the less secondary solid phase (BCC phase) formed during the end of the solidification within the fusion zone, the higher cracking sensibility of the samples. The remnant liquid film existing in the inter-dendrites region weakened the bonding between each dendrite, which triggers the cracking under thermal stress. (C) 2019 The Authors.

The numerous advantages of flexible materials over rigid materials, especially the fabrication of deformable electronic devices, have accelerated research on polymer substrates. Electrically conductive materials with amphiphobicity could further improve the performance of electronic devices. Herein, an amphiphobic and electrically conductive coating was fabricated on a flexible polymer substrate. An overhang structure was constructed on well-distributed microscale pillars using sputtering by a glancing angle deposition technique. The surface was then chemically modified using drysurf solution. The coating exhibited high repellency to various liquids with different surface tensions. In addition, the good self-cleaning property made it easy to dean the contaminants on the surface using water droplets. To test the feasibility of the deposited Ag film on the polymer substrate as a flexible electrode, a cyclic fatigue test was employed. Under the repeated fatigue test. the coating performed well, with a minimal change in the electrical resistance for 5000 bending cycles. Furthermore, the coating presented good resistance to chemical immersion tests. The superior performance in the amphiphobicity, self-cleaning property, and mechanical and chemical robustness promised it to be a good candidate for electrode materials for flexible electronics.

A multiscale approach is adopted in which the explicitly resolved top coat microstructural features are embedded in a larger domain. Within the computational cell, splat interfaces are modeled as being located on a sinusoidal interface in combination with a random distribution of pores. Parametric studies are conducted for different splat interface waviness, spacing, pore volume fraction and fracture properties of the splat interface. The results are quantified in terms of crack nucleation temperature and total microcrack length. It is found that the amount of cracking in TBCs actually decreases with increased porosity up to a critical volume fraction. In contrast, the presence of splats is always detrimental to the TBC performance. This detrimental effect is reduced for the splat interfaces with high waviness and spacing compared to those with low waviness and spacing. The crack initiation temperature was found to be linearly dependent on the normal fracture properties of the splat interface. Insights derived from the numerical results aid in engineering the microstructure of practical TBC systems for improved resistance against thermal fracture.","[Krishnasamy, Jayaprakash; Turteltaub, Sergio; van der Zwaag, Sybrand] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Aerosp Engn, Kluyverweg 1, NL-2629 HS Delft, Netherlands; [Ponnusami, Sathiskumar A.] City Univ London, Dept Mech Engn & Aeronaut, Northampton Sq, London EC1V 0HB, England","Delft University of Technology; City St Georges, University of London; City, University of London","Krishnasamy, J (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Aerosp Engn, Kluyverweg 1, NL-2629 HS Delft, Netherlands.",J.Krishnasamy-1@tudelft.nl; sathiskumar.ponnusami@city.ac.uk; S.R.Turteltaub@tudelft.nl; S.vanderZwaag@tudelft.nl,"Ponnusami, Sathiskumar/AAT-9212-2020; Turteltaub, Sergio/AAA-9386-2019","Turteltaub, Sergio/0000-0003-3706-9100; Ponnusami, Sathiskumar A./0000-0002-2143-8971",European Union's seventh framework program (FP7) through the NMP SAMBA project [309849],European Union's seventh framework program (FP7) through the NMP SAMBA project(European Union (EU)),This work was funded in part by the European Union's seventh framework program (FP7) through the NMP SAMBA project (Grant Number 309849).

Previously, flame spraying of polymers has been successfully performed to obtain durable icephobic coatings, providing an interesting solution for applications facing icing problems, e.g. in marine, aviation, energy, and transportation industry. However, the fine tailoring of the process parameters represents a necessary strategy for optimising the coating production due to the unique thermal properties of each polymer. For this purpose, we vary the heat input of the process during flame spraying of the coating, by changing the transverse speed and the spraying distance. The results show that the variation in the process parameters strongly influenced the quality of the polymer coating, including its areal roughness, thickness, chemical composition, thermal stability, and degree of crystallinity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these properties significantly affect the icephobic behaviour of the surface within the spray window of the chosen parameters. In conclusion, the relationship between the thermal degradation of the polymer and the icephobicity of the surface was defined. This highlights the importance of process parameter optimisation in order to achieve the desired icephobic performance of the LPDE coatings.","[Donadei, Valentina; Koivuluoto, Heli; Sarlin, Essi; Vuoristo, Petri] Tampere Univ, Fac Engn & Nat Sci, POB 589, FI-33014 Tampere, Finland",Tampere University,"Donadei, V (corresponding author), Tampere Univ, Fac Engn & Nat Sci, POB 589, FI-33014 Tampere, Finland.",valentina.donadei@tuni.fi,"Donadei, Valentina/S-6356-2019; Vuoristo, Petri/G-4257-2014; Sarlin, Essi/B-9062-2016; Koivuluoto, Heli/B-3248-2016","Donadei, Valentina/0000-0001-9382-8613; Sarlin, Essi/0000-0002-2525-9639; Vuoristo, Petri/0000-0003-1833-2866; Koivuluoto, Heli/0000-0003-4372-3981",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant [722497],European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant(Marie Curie Actions),"Authors thank the LubISS (Lubricant Impregnated Slippery Surfaces) project that has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant Agreement No. 722497.

Improving surface properties is an effective way to improve the durability of these materials. In this study, a hydrophobic coating was applied to the surface of cement mortar by chemical modification of low surface energy materials. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) showed that low surface energy substances are linked to hydration products through chemical bonds. A water contact angle test indicates that the surface of cement mortar changed from hydrophilic (theta = 14 degrees) to hydrophobic (theta = 140 degrees) after chemical modification. The cumulative water uptake of hydrophobic samples decreased by 90%. Meanwhile, the wear resistance of the hydrophobic coatings was excellent. Compared with the baseline sample, mass loss rate, flexural strength, and compressive strength of hydrophobic coating samples increased several-fold in the FTC test. Microstructural changes of the mortar were characterized by scanning electron microscopy. The results show that a hydrophobic coating can significantly improve the freeze-thaw resistance of cement-based materials. The formation of a hydrophobic layer on the surface of cement-based materials can improve their durability. The research results not only have applications in civil engineering but will also have great impact in the restoration of historic structures.","[Song, Zijian; Lu, Zhongyuan; Lai, Zhenyu] Southwest Univ Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Environm Friendly Energy Mat, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Mianyang 621010, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Song, Zijian] Mianyang Vocat & Tech Coll, Mianyang 621000, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Southwest University of Science & Technology - China,"Song, ZJ; Lu, ZY (corresponding author), Southwest Univ Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Environm Friendly Energy Mat, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Mianyang 621010, Sichuan, Peoples R China.;Song, ZJ (corresponding author), Mianyang Vocat & Tech Coll, Mianyang 621000, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",szj2009189@163.com; luy@swust.edu.cn,"Lu, Zhong-Yuan/I-9142-2012",,National Key RD Plan [2016YFC0701004]; Sichuan Science and Technology Program [2019ZDZX0024]; Doctoral Research Foundation of Southwest University of Science and Technology [18zx7134],National Key RD Plan; Sichuan Science and Technology Program; Doctoral Research Foundation of Southwest University of Science and Technology,"This work was supported by the National Key R&D Plan (grant no. 2016YFC0701004), the Sichuan Science and Technology Program (no. 2019ZDZX0024), and the Doctoral Research Foundation of Southwest University of Science and Technology (18zx7134).",,46.0,9,9,4,40,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1687-8434,1687-8442,,ADV MATER SCI ENG,Adv.

The results showed that nano-scale La2O3 particles were formed through the in-situ reaction between La and O elements in the material system. With appropriate LaB6 addition (3.0%), the microstructure was refined and the second phase reinforcements were distributed more homogeneously. In addition, the oxygen elements in the coating were bound through the formation of La2O3, and the residual stress concentration was obviously reduced compared with that in the coating without LaB6 addition. However, the beneficial effect would be disappeared because of the tendency to create clusters when the additive content of LaB6 was excessive. During the solidfication process, the first generated La2O3 particles had a significant hetregeneous nucleation effect especially on the TiB phase in the coating. The grain refinement effect played the equally and even higher important role as the dispersion strengthening in the system. The microhardness and wear resistance of the coating with 3.0% LaB6 addition were improved. In addition, its high temperature oxidation resistance was also obviously increased, and the related mechanisms were discussed. (C) 2019 The Authors.

In this study, the ZEK100 magnesium alloy was pre-deformed with a high-pressure torsion (HPT) process and then fabricated hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings with different contents of Mg(OH)(2) nanopowder via hydrothermal method. The specimens were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Meanwhile, the corrosion behavior of the specimens was evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and hydrogen evolution tests. Results showed that HPT processing refined the grain size and introduced a great number of twins, resulting in the enhancement of microhardness and Young's modulus of ZEK100. The abundant fine grains, twins and grain boundaries in HPT-ZEK100 can provide more nucleation sites for the HA crystal, resulting in a denser, thicker HA coating with smaller crystal sizes. In terms of the amount of Mg(OH)(2) nanopowder, a 0.3 mg/mL content was most appropriate for the deposition of HA. In addition, HPT technique and surface modification by HA coating simultaneously reduced the corrosion rate of ZEK100 magnesium alloy, which virtually expands the biological application of magnesium alloys.

The flame-retardant property and combustion behavior of FR-PP was studied by means of the limiting oxygen index, UL 94 vertical burning and cone-calorimeter tests. Results indicate that the partial replacement of APP with AlPO4 in the FR-PP composites showed significant synergistic effects during combustion. The interactions between AlPO4 and APP were examined by means of thermogravimetry and thermogravimetry-Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analyses. FTIR spectra and X-ray diffraction spectra were obtained to detect residues of APP/AlPO4 mixtures at different temperatures. Scanning-electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectrometry was used to analyze the condensed-phase residues from cone-calorimeter tests. Scanning-electron microscopy showed that the crystallized aluminum metaphosphate that was derived from the crystal transition of AlPO4 sealed the char residue surface and contributed to the formation of a more uniform and compact char. Thus, surface char with excellent barrier properties will protect the underlying polymer matrix from further degradation and combustion. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Extensive nanoindentation tests are performed to spatially map the properties of bond coat, top coat and bond coat-top coat interface regions of as-coated and thermally cycled TBCs and the resulting spatial property maps (hardness and elastic modulus maps) are compared with the corresponding microstructures to establish correlations. Excellent correlation is observed between the microstructure and the mechanical properties at the micrometer length scale. The various microstructural features and phases including thermally grown oxide (TGO) at the bond coat-top coat interface are accurately captured by the mapping technique. A deconvolution technique based on k-means data clustering algorithm is used to obtain the phase level properties from the maps and also generate mechanical phase maps to visualize the evolution of mechanical properties with thermal cycling which enables a holistic understanding of degradation mechanisms operating at various levels of thermal cycling. The capabilities of the high speed nanoindentation mapping demonstrated in this work have important implications for microstructure based finite element modeling and also for development of data-driven models for predicting the life of TBCs.

The above findings indicate that the alternative pelletising method is potentially useful for the use of agglomerated nanoparticles as feedstock in the fabrication of bi-modal structured flame-sprayed ceramic coatings.","[Alberto Arias, Jhoman; Milena Hurtado, Francy; Estrada, Geraldine; Cadavid, Edwin; Vargas, Fabio] Univ Antioquia, GIPIMME, St 67 53-108, Medellin 050010, Colombia; [Alberto Arias, Jhoman; Milena Hurtado, Francy; Estrada, Geraldine; Cadavid, Edwin; Vargas, Fabio] Univ Antioquia, GIMACYR, St 67 53-108, Medellin 050010, Colombia; [Vargas, Freddy; Rincon Ortiz, Mauricio] UIS, Grp Invest Desarrollo & Teccnol Nuevos Mat, Cr 27 Calle 9, Santander 680002, Spain; [Constanza Palacio, Claudia] Univ EAFIT, GEMA, Cra 49 7s-50, Medellin 050010, Colombia",Universidad de Antioquia; Universidad de Antioquia; Universidad EAFIT,"Ortiz, MR (corresponding author), Carrera 28 33-84 Apt 1604, Bucaramanga, Colombia.",mrincono@saber.uis.edu.co,"Sierra-Vargas, Fabio/AAK-7943-2020","Palacio, Claudia/0000-0001-8858-7165; Cadavid, Edwin/0000-0001-9452-4240","FONDO NACIONAL DE FINANCIAMIENTO PARA LA CIENCIA, LA TECNOLOGiA Y LA INNOVACION FRANCISCO JOSE DE CALDAS COLCIENCIAS [FP44842-302-2016, FP44842-124-2017, CT-657-2018]","FONDO NACIONAL DE FINANCIAMIENTO PARA LA CIENCIA, LA TECNOLOGiA Y LA INNOVACION FRANCISCO JOSE DE CALDAS COLCIENCIAS","The authors are grateful to FONDO NACIONAL DE FINANCIAMIENTO PARA LA CIENCIA, LA TECNOLOGiA Y LA INNOVACION FRANCISCO JOSE DE CALDAS COLCIENCIAS, for supporting the projects grant numbers: FP44842-302-2016, FP44842-124-2017 and CT-657-2018.",,52.0,6,6,2,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0272-8842,1873-3956,,CERAM INT,Ceram.

By adjusting the thickness of the PCN shell, the PB@PCN nanohybrid with the best comprehensive performance was obtained for tumor treatment and imaging. The integrated nanosystem as a tandem catalyst is able to convert H2O2 to O-2 through the PB core, and then the O-2 is directly injected into the PCN framework, leading to a high quantum yield of singlet oxygen to kill tumor cells and attack heat shock proteins (HSPs). The nanohybrid was further camouflaged by a tumor cell membrane (PB@PCN@MEM) with good immune evasion and active targeting ability. Upon accumulation at the tumor site, PN@PCN@MEM showed an enhanced photodynamic therapeutic effect against hypoxic tumor cells. Furthermore, coupled with the photothermal therapy of PB, photothermal/photodynamic synergistic therapy of tumors can be realized. In addition, due to its excellent imaging performance, this core-shell nanohybrid can be employed for the multimodal image-guided therapy of tumors.","[Cheng, Qian; Li, Zi-Hao; Sun, Yun-Xia; Zhang, Xian-Zheng] Wuhan Univ, Key Lab Biomed Polymers, Minist Educ, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Qian; Li, Zi-Hao; Sun, Yun-Xia; Zhang, Xian-Zheng] Wuhan Univ, Dept Chem, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China",Wuhan University; Wuhan University,"Zhang, XZ (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Key Lab Biomed Polymers, Minist Educ, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China.;Zhang, XZ (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Dept Chem, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China.",xz-zhang@whu.edu.cn,"L., Michael/HNP-8517-2023",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [51833007, 51873161, 51690152]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51833007, 51873161, and 51690152).

Hydrated rhodium chloride is shown to be an effective precursor for sol-gel processing of Rh2O3. Heating in air to 600 degrees C crystallizes single-phase Rh2O3 (I) while fully preserving the cubic symmetry 3D pore-solid architecture, whereas at 750 degrees C only the in-plane pore order is retained. Interestingly, there is no crystalline-crystalline transformation upon heating to 1000 degrees C, despite distinct microstructure coarsening. The thermal stability of the sol-gel-derived material in terms of mesostructure retention can be significantly enhanced by atomic layer deposition surface treatment, making the block copolymer-templated thin films interesting for demanding applications.

The scratch energy density - which represents the resistance to abrasive wear - could be increased by a factor of 1.5. Under abrasive-adhesive stress loading conditions, the determined wear volume decreased by a factor of almost 5.

A concurrent multiscale approach is utilised whereby the microstructural features of the TBC are explicitly resolved within a unit cell embedded in a larger domain. Within the unit cell, a random distribution of pores is modelled along with three different layers in a TBC system, namely, the Top Coat (TC), the Bond Coat (BC) and the Thermally Grown Oxide (TGO). The TC/TGO and the TGO/BC interfaces are assumed to be sinusoidal of specified amplitude and frequency extracted from experimental observations reported in the literature. To simulate fracture in the TBC, cohesive elements are inserted throughout the inter-element boundaries in order to enable arbitrary crack initiation and propagation. A bilinear traction-separation relation with specified fracture properties for each layer is used to model the constitutive behaviour of the cohesive elements. Parametric studies are conducted for various pore geometrical features, porosity, fracture properties of Top Coat layer and Thermally Grown Oxide layer thicknesses. The results are quantified in terms of crack initiation and evolution. It is found that the presence of pores has a beneficial effect on the fracture behavior up to a certain value of porosity after which the pores become detrimental to the overall performance. Insights derived from the numerical results can help in understanding the failure behavior of practical TBC systems and further aid in engineering the TBC microstructure for a desired fracture behavior.","[Krishnasamy, Jayaprakash; Ponnusami, Sathiskumar A.; Turteltaub, Sergio; van der Zwaag, Sybrand] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Aerosp Engn, Kluyverweg 1, NL-2629 HS Delft, Netherlands; [Ponnusami, Sathiskumar A.] City Univ London, Dept Mech Engn & Aerosp, Northampton Sq, London EC1V 0HB, England","Delft University of Technology; City St Georges, University of London; City, University of London","Krishnasamy, J (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Aerosp Engn, Kluyverweg 1, NL-2629 HS Delft, Netherlands.",J.Krishnasamy-1@tudelft.nl; sathiskumar.ponnusami@city.ac.uk; S.R.Turteltaub@tudelft.nl; S.vanderZwaag@tudelft.nl,"Turteltaub, Sergio/AAA-9386-2019; Ponnusami, Sathiskumar/AAT-9212-2020","Ponnusami, Sathiskumar A./0000-0002-2143-8971; Turteltaub, Sergio/0000-0003-3706-9100",European Union's seventh framework program (FP7) through the NMP SAMBA project [309849],European Union's seventh framework program (FP7) through the NMP SAMBA project(European Union (EU)),This work was funded in part by the European Union's seventh framework program (FP7) through the NMP SAMBA project (grant number 309849).

It is found that the higher the electrolyte temperature, the lower is the breakdown voltage of oxide layer. This is probably because films formed at higher temperatures are thinner and denser. Moreover, electrolyte temperature plays an important role in the physical properties of the films. As the electrolyte temperature increases from 20 to 50 degrees C, the hardness of the oxide layer increases. Friction test against steel balls indicates that wear scars become narrower for films formed at higher temperatures because the films are harder, as indicated by the Vickers hardness. The thinner and denser nature of the oxide film formed at 50 degrees C is also advantageous for heat transfer when film is used as a heat sink. Laser flash test results show very fast heat transfer for AZ91D with plasma anodized oxide layer formed at higher temperatures.","[Lee, Sung-Hyung] Gakko Hojin Kitahara Gakuen, Hirakawa 0360146, Japan; [Lee, Sung-Hyung; Yashiro, Hitoshi; Aoki, Kazuki; Nanao, Hidetaka] Iwate Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Sci, Morioka, Iwate 0208551, Japan; [Kure-Chu, Song-Zhu] Nagoya Inst Technol, Mat Funct & Design, Nagoya, Aichi 4668555, Japan; [Lee, Sung-Hyung] Guangde Grp Holdings Corp Ltd, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Iwate University; Nagoya Institute of Technology,"Lee, SH (corresponding author), Gakko Hojin Kitahara Gakuen, Hirakawa 0360146, Japan.;Lee, SH (corresponding author), Iwate Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Sci, Morioka, Iwate 0208551, Japan.;Lee, SH (corresponding author), Guangde Grp Holdings Corp Ltd, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",shlee@wayokai.jp,"KURE-CHU, Song-Zhu/K-3564-2016",,,,,,19.0,0,0,1,10,MATERIALS RESEARCH SOC KOREA,SEOUL,"RM 903, KOREA SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY BLDG, 635-4, YEOKSAM-DONG, KANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-703, SOUTH KOREA",1225-0562,2287-7258,,KOR J MATER RES,Kor.

In this study, we investigated the effects of NaCl on pyrraline formation using glucose-lysine model systems. NaCl, especially at 0.50%, promoted Maillard browning and pyrraline formation, with a simultaneous increase in the 3-deoxyglucosone concentration. To reduce the rate of pyrraline formation, NaCl coated with different gums and starches were used. The results showed that NaCl encapsulation is an effective approach to mitigate pyrraline and 3-deoxyglucosone formation.

The coated substrates were assembled in a microfluidic device for photocatalytic studies fabricated by selective transmission laser welding. The synthesized TiO2 showed a competitive activity compared with commercial TiO2 nanopowders. Furthermore, the coated catalyst remained active and intact even after a long-term reaction run. The inkjet printing method can be utilized for the efficient immobilization of catalytic films onto reactor walls in the design of continuous flow reactors. A dispersed TiO2 sol was prepared by the thermohydrolysis of TiCl4 below 100 degrees C. The resulting sol was stabilized by using ethylene glycol and directly printed onto the substrate without further heat processing. The printability and colloidal stability of the inks were assessed by measuring their rheological and interfacial properties. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis identified the synthesized TiO2 as pure anatase nanosized particles (similar to 4.5 nm) verified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The photocatalytic activity of the printed layers was studied in the microreactor based on the degradation of methylene blue.

The effect of electrolyte medium for the ZnO deposition, annealing treatment and interface modification with graphene oxide (GO) layer on the photoelectrical properties was analyzed. The electrochemical results indicated a markedly dependent Cu2O film electrodeposition on the GO-modified ZnO films. The modification of ZnO/Cu2O interface with GO nanosheets and annealing treatment results in improved interface properties, varying morphology and defects in ZnO lattice that further lead to enhanced performance of the proposed heterojunction solar cells. While the obtained results indicate that the properties of GO coating need to be tailored for improved performance, a synergetic effect of the GO addition and annealing treatment on the photoelectric properties of the electrodeposited heterojunction is achieved.

This investigation is relevant to CMAS resistant thermal barrier coatings (TBC) used in aircraft engines. CMAS is a generic term for the molten siliceous deposits resulting from the ingestion of mineral particles with the intake air. The aim was to assess the influence of the rare earth on the reaction kinetics, solubility limits and underlying phase equilibria in a model CAS melt. RE2O3 (RE = Nd, Sm, Gd, Dy and Yb) were selected to span a wide range of trivalent lanthanide sesquioxides and Lewis basicities. Powders dispersed in CAS glass-beads were reacted at 1200 degrees C and quenched after several durations. All the RE2O3 led to the formation of metastable apatite, and then to stabilization of cyclosilicate in CAS. Disilicate Yb2Si2O7 was also obtained in Yb2O3 bead-sample during early-stage of interaction. However, RE2O3 oxide basicity has a direct influence on silicates (apatite, disilicate and cyclosilicate) solubility limits in CAS, on RE-apatite crystal growth as well as on induction time for RE-cyclosilicate nucleation. The results are discussed in the light of crystal chemistry, thermodynamic considerations and RE cation field strength (Z/r(2)) which is alternative to define oxide basicity.","[Perrudin, F.; Vidal-Setif, M.

ZnO thin films were synthesized from one-step spin coating-pyrolysis technique using zinc neodecanoate precursor. X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-visible optical transmission spectrometry and photoluminescence spectroscopy suggested conversion to polycrystalline ZnO phase for decomposition temperatures higher than 400 degrees C. A 15 % precursor concentration was found to produce optimal TFT performance on annealing at 500 degrees C, due to generation of sufficient charge percolation pathways. The device performance was found to improve upon increasing the annealing temperature and the optimal saturation mobility of 0.1 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) with I-ON/I-OFF ratio similar to 10(7) was achieved at 700 degrees C annealing temperature. The analysis of experimental results based on theoretical models to understand charge transport envisaged that the grain boundary depletion region is major source of deep level traps and their effective removal at increased annealing temperature leads to evolution of transistor performance.","[Tiwale, Nikhil; Rubio-Lara, Juan; Welland, Mark E.] Univ Cambridge, Nanosci Ctr, Cambridge CB3 0FF, England; [Senanayak, Satyaprasad P.] Univ Cambridge, Cavendish Lab, Optoelect Grp, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England; [Alaverdyan, Yury] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Graphene Ctr, Cambridge CB3 0FA, England; [Senanayak, Satyaprasad P.] CSIR Inst Minerals & Mat Technol, Bhubaneswar 751013, Orissa, India",University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge; Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - Institute of Minerals & Materials Technology (IMMT),"Tiwale, N; Welland, ME (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Nanosci Ctr, Cambridge CB3 0FF, England.",nikhil.tiwale@cantab.net; mew10@cam.ac.uk,"Rubio-Lara, Juan/P-4445-2019; Tiwale, Nikhil/M-9928-2018","Rubio-Lara, Juan Antonio/0000-0001-9617-3691; Tiwale, Nikhil/0000-0001-8229-7108","Cambridge Commonwealth, European & International Trust; University of Cambridge Student Registry, Lundgren Trust and Downing College; Royal Society; IIT Bombay","Cambridge Commonwealth, European & International Trust; University of Cambridge Student Registry, Lundgren Trust and Downing College; Royal Society(Royal Society); IIT Bombay","NT would like to acknowledge the Cambridge Commonwealth, European & International Trust for the financial support towards his Ph.D. studies under Cambridge-India Partnership Scholarship and Prof. Prita Pant, IIT Bombay as a co-supervisor towards the scholarship.

The addition of increasing amounts of lithium carbonate (0, 500, 1000, and 2000 ppm), yielded homogeneous hybrid coatings with increased connectivity of nanometric silica cross-link nodes, covalently linked to the PMMA matrix, and improved adhesion to the aluminum substrate (AA7075). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), performed in 3.5% NaCl aqueous solution, showed that the improved structural properties of coatings with higher lithium loadings result in an increased corrosion resistance, with an impedance modulus up to 50 G Omega cm(2), and revealed that the lithium induced self-healing ability significantly improves their durability. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) suggest that the regeneration process occurs by means of lithium ions leaching from the adjacent coating toward the corrosion spot, which is restored by a protective layer of precipitated Li rich aluminum hydroxide species. An analogue mechanism has been proposed for artificially scratched coatings presenting an increase of the impedance modulus after salt spray test compared to the lithium free coating. These results evidence the active role of lithium ions in improving the passive barrier of the PMMA-silica coating and in providing through the self-restoring ability a significantly extended service life of AA7075 alloy exposed to saline environment.","[Trentin, Andressa; Harb, Samarah V.; Uvida, Mayara C.; Pulcinelli, Sandra H.; Santilli, Celso V.; Hammer, Peter] Sao Paulo State Univ UNESP, Inst Chem, BR-14800060 Araraquara, SP, Brazil; [Marcoen, Kristof; Pletincx, Sven; Terryn, Herman; Hauffman, Tom] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Mat & Chem, Res Grp Electrochem & Surface Engn, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",Universidade Estadual Paulista; Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Hammer, P (corresponding author), Sao Paulo State Univ UNESP, Inst Chem, BR-14800060 Araraquara, SP, Brazil.",peter.hammer@unesp.br,"santilli, celso/A-1031-2008; Trentin, Andressa/AAX-1568-2020; Pulcinelli, Sandra/E-1108-2012; Uvida, Mayara Carla/AAU-1380-2020; Harb, Samarah/AAH-2694-2019; Terryn, Herman/A-2255-2013; Vargas Harb, Samarah/G-2905-2014; Hauffman, Tom/J-2655-2017; Hammer, Peter/C-7585-2012","Trentin, Andressa/0000-0003-2862-8070; Terryn, Herman/0000-0003-2639-5496; Vargas Harb, Samarah/0000-0001-7148-4661; Uvida, Mayara Carla/0000-0003-0810-9492; Hauffman, Tom/0000-0002-3456-0271; Hammer, Peter/0000-0002-3823-0050; Marcoen, Kristof/0000-0003-2831-483X","Hercules program [ZW13_07]; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2015/11907-2, 2017/14061-2, 2015/09342-7]; INCT Tecnologias Ecoeficientes Avancadas em Produtos Cimenticios Advanced Eco-efficient Cement-Based Technologie-CEMtec [88887.136401/2017-00]; CAPES [001]; Research Foundation Flanders (FWO); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) [424133/2016-4, 307905/2018-7, 421081/2016-3]; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [15/09342-7, 17/14061-2, 15/11907-2] Funding Source: FAPESP",Hercules program; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); INCT Tecnologias Ecoeficientes Avancadas em Produtos Cimenticios Advanced Eco-efficient Cement-Based Technologie-CEMtec; CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Research Foundation Flanders (FWO)(FWO); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)),"The authors would like to acknowledge the National Laboratory of Synchrotron Light Source (LNLS) for SAXS beamline access and the Hercules program under grant agreement ZW13_07 for ToF-SIMS measurements.

The drawback is that the air layer is short-lived due to solvation into the surrounding liquid. While manipulating the solubility of gases using temperature is a possible approach, it generally requires inefficiently heating large volumes of water. Following the demonstrated ability to maintain air bubbles on superhydrophobic surfaces for drag reduction, this article introduces a novel method of extracting gas from water to replenish and stabilize the plastron on superhydrophobic surfaces for sustained antifouling abilities. This method involves locally heating the liquid surrounding a superhydrophobic coating, reducing gas solubility, and causing the gas to nucleate at the liquid-air interface. The approach requires a relatively low energy input, due to the small volume of locally heated water. With a constant supply of equilibrated water and minimal energy input, the plastron can survive indefinitely without the need for a mechanical delivery of air. The thermoregenerating superhydrophobic samples were shown to exhibit excellent antifouling behavior and inhibited diatom attachment over a period of 5 days.","[Simovich, Tomer; Rosenhahn, Axel] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Analyt Chem Biointerfaces, D-44801 Bochum, Germany; [Lamb, Robert N.] Canadian Light Source, Off Naval Res, Saskatoon, SK S7N 2V3, Canada",Ruhr University Bochum; University of Saskatchewan,"Simovich, T (corresponding author), Ruhr Univ Bochum, Analyt Chem Biointerfaces, D-44801 Bochum, Germany.",tomer.simovich@rub.de,"Rosenhahn, Axel/F-7319-2011","Rosenhahn, Axel/0000-0001-9393-7190","Australian Research Council [DP120104536]; US Office of Naval Research [N000141512324, N000141612979]; U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) [N000141612979, N000141512324] Funding Source: U.S. Department of Defense (DOD)",Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); US Office of Naval Research(United States Department of DefenseUnited States NavyOffice of Naval Research); U.S. Department of Defense (DOD)(United States Department of Defense),The financial support of both the Australian Research Council's Discovery Projects (Project DP120104536) and the US Office of Naval Research (N000141512324 and N000141612979) are gratefully acknowledged.,,29.0,25,26,6,64,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",1438-1656,1527-2648,,ADV ENG MATER,Adv.

Here, the stability of PEDOT:PSS microelectrodes is examined over a period of four months in cell culture media enriched with fetal bovine serum. The electrochemical impedance remains constant for most electrodes throughout the study, and only small changes in the structure of functional electrodes are observed.

Therefore, coated filters are immersed for 30 s in molten steel (42CrMo4) at 1580 degrees C. Mainly by microstructural and chemical analyses, the immersed filters as well as the solidified steel are characterized. Due to the reducing atmosphere of the heat treatment during sample manufacturing, the formation of aluminum titanate phases in the coating is not observed. During immersion, on the one hand, titania acts as the sintering agent for alumina within the coating and for precipitated alumina inclusions from the melt. On the other hand, dissolved titanium in the melt decreases the surface tension and thus increases wetting of the steel melt on the filter surface. The results indicate that more but smaller alumina inclusions remain in the solidified steel if titania is added to the coating. Thus, the modification of alumina inclusions by adding titania to the filter coating presents a way to tailor these inclusions depending on the product's application.","[Schmidt, Anne; Fruhstorfer, Jens; Dudczig, Steffen; Aneziris, Christos G.] TU Bergakad Freiberg, Inst Ceram Glass & Construct Mat, D-09596 Freiberg, Germany",Technical University Freiberg,"Schmidt, A (corresponding author), TU Bergakad Freiberg, Inst Ceram Glass & Construct Mat, D-09596 Freiberg, Germany.",anne.schmidt@ikgb.tu-freiberg.de,,"Dudczig, Steffen/0000-0001-6931-7119; Fruhstorfer, Jens/0000-0003-3437-9357","German Research Foundation (DFG), Collaborative Research Centre [CRC 920]","German Research Foundation (DFG), Collaborative Research Centre(German Research Foundation (DFG))","The authors would like to acknowledge the support of R.

Both the life expectancy and efficiency of PV modules can be improved by reducing the transmittance of the destructive UV radiation through the cover glass without compromising the transmittance in the visible wavelength region. In addition, if the absorbed UV photons can be down-shifted to wavelengths that can be more efficiently converted to electrical energy, an additional increase of the PV efficiency could be achieved. In this study we have investigated transparent ZnO and TiO2 thin films deposited by spray pyrolysis on soda lime silicate float glass as functional layers on PV cover glass. The optical bandgap, UV-cutoff, UV-Vis transmittance, reflectivity (total and diffuse) and photoluminescence have been determined. The ZnO coating shifted the optical bandgap to longer wavelengths, resulting in a reduction of the transmittance of destructive UV radiation by up to similar to 85%. Distinct photoluminescence peaks at 377 nm and at 640 nm were observed for one of the ZnO samples. The TiO2 coated glasses also showed an increased UV cutoff, which resulted in a reduction of transmittance of destructive UV radiation by up to 75%. However, no photoluminescence peaks could be observed from the TiO2 films with 325 nm excitation laser, which can be explained by the fact that only indirect interband transitions are accessible at this excitation wavelength. Deposition of both ZnO and TiO2 coatings resulted in a reduction of the transmitted light convertible by PV modules, by up to 12.3 and 21.8%, respectively. The implication of the results is discussed in terms of lifetime expectancy and efficiency of PV modules.","[Johansson, Wilhelm; Jonson, Bo] Linnaeus Univ, Fac Technol, Dept Built Environm & Energy Technol, LNU Glass Grp, Vaxjo, Sweden; [Peralta, Albert; Anand, Srinivasan] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Sch Engn Sci, Dept Aoplied Phys, Kista, Sweden; [Osterlund, Lars] Uppsala Univ, Dept Engn Sci, Angstrom Lab, Uppsala, Sweden; [Karlsson, Stefan] RISE Res Inst Sweden, Built Environm Div, RISE Glass, Vaxjo, Sweden",Linnaeus University; Royal Institute of Technology; Uppsala University; RISE Research Institutes of Sweden,"Karlsson, S (corresponding author), RISE Res Inst Sweden, Built Environm Div, RISE Glass, Vaxjo, Sweden.",stefan.karlsson@ri.se,"Österlund, Lars/E-9125-2015; Karlsson, Stefan/H-6308-2019","Anand, Srinivasan/0000-0003-4991-0585; Peralta Amores, Albert/0000-0001-6616-4997; Karlsson, Stefan/0000-0003-2160-6979",,,,,46.0,41,42,2,14,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-8016,,,FRONT MATER,Front.

However, researchers still experience technological and economical challenge, since many systems that use this energy still have low efficiency and high cost. In this way, the development of new materials and technologies to increase the efficiency of solar thermal collectors is both a challenge and a necessity. In this context, the objective of this work is to obtain and analyze selective surfaces for solar thermal collectors, using cashew nut shell liquid. The cashew nut shell liquid can be classified as technical or natural, depending on the mode of extraction of cashew liquid. An experimental bench was built to simulate a flat plate solar collector under real operating conditions. For comparative purposes, the tests were performed between the cashew nut shell liquid and the commercial surface (MRTiNOX). In order to verify the structure morphology and the chemical composition of the surface, analyzes were performed by scanning electron microscopy. In order to identify the presence of components after the sintering process, the infrared analysis technique was used. To analyze the surface absorbance, the ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy absorbance technique was used. With the tests in real conditions, it was possible to perform the temperature measurements, and later, with the energy balance, the absorptivity, emissivity, and efficiency were calculated. The technical cashew nut shell liquid presented efficiency of 42.86%, while the MRTiNOX, 41.8%. In contrast, natural cashew nut shell liquid obtained efficiency of 31.28%. Thus, the use of technical cashew nut shell liquid, a low-cost regional product, was presented as a viable and satisfactory solution for cost reduction in solar thermal collectors.","[Pinho, Diego Caitano; Aguiar Freire, Francisco Nivaldo; Albuquerque Araujo, Felipe Alves; Dutra, Kaio Hemerson; Teixeira, Edwalder Silva] Univ Fed Ceara, Lab Filmes Finos Energia Renovaveis, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil; [Vieira da Silva, Maria Eugenia; Costa Rocha, Paulo Alexandre] Univ Fed Ceara, Lab Energia Solar & Gas Nat, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Ceara; Universidade Federal do Ceara,"Pinho, DC (corresponding author), Univ Fed Ceara, Av Univ 2853, BR-60020181 Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.",diegopynho@gmail.com,"; Rocha, Paulo/G-5784-2012","Pinho, Diego Caitano/0000-0001-9324-3375; Rocha, Paulo/0000-0002-4366-366X",fundacao cearense de apoio ao desenvolvimento cientifico e tecnologico (Funcap),fundacao cearense de apoio ao desenvolvimento cientifico e tecnologico (Funcap)(Fundacao Cearense de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (FUNCAP)),The author(s) received financial support for the research through of the fundacao cearense de apoio ao desenvolvimento cientifico e tecnologico (Funcap).,,12.0,1,1,0,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1464-4207,2041-3076,,P I MECH ENG L-J MAT,Proc.

Synthesis of ATO-incorporated composite latex with tailored structure was performed in a controlled manner by optimizing the process conditions via modified MEP. Antimony doped tin oxide (ATO) nanoparticles (NPs) were functionalized with 3-methacryloxy propyl trimethoxysilane (MPS) to improve the crosslinking between ATO NPs and polymers via MEP. ATO-incorporated composite MANs/poly(methyl methaaylate-co-butyl acrylate) (MANs/poly(MMA-co-BA)) latex was obtained by polymerizing ATO-incorporated composite latex with methyl methacrylate (MMA) and butyl acrylate (BA). Investigations revealed homogeneous distribution of ATO NPs in the composite (MANs/poly(MMA-co-BA)) latex owing to the better cross-linking with poly(MMA-co-BA). The spectral selectivity of the MANs/poly(MMA-co-BA) composite film was determined by ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV-Vis-NIR) spectroscopy. Interestingly, MANs/poly( MMA-co-BA) films exhibited stronger NIR-shielding properties by blocking up to 70% of NIR radiation in the range of 780-2500 nm while maintaining better visible light transparency of >80%. The results demonstrated that the prepared MANs/poly(MMA-co-BA) latex can be used as a spectrum-selective coating for next-generation transparent and IR-shielding materials. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Nanoscale characterisation showed that the transition from the arcs to the soft regime was concomitant with the gradual formation of a 1:1 mullite/alumina lamellar nanocomposite (approximate to 120 nm thick) that filled the cavity of the PEO pancake structure. Combined with plasma diagnostic techniques, a three-step growth mechanism was proposed: (i) local melting of alumina under the PEO micro-discharges (approximate to 3200 K at high heating rate approximate to 3 x 10(8) K . s(-1)); (ii) progressive silicon enrichment of the melt coming from the electrolyte; and (iii) quenching of the melt at a cooling rate of approximate to 3.3 x 10(7) K . s(-1) as the micro-discharge extinguishes. Under such severe cooling conditions, the solidification process was non-equilibrium as predicted by the metastable SiO2 - Al2O3 binary phase diagram. This resulted in phase separation where pure alumina lamellae alternate periodically with 1:1 mullite lamellae.

This type of alloy is more appropriately classified as a complex concentrated alloy (CCA) rather than an HEA. Here, we report a simple strategy for the fabrication of CCA coatings with high mechanical properties. In this strategy, the face-centred cubic (FCC)-based Co25Cr25Cu12.5Ni25Al12.5 (at.%) system was chosen, and spark plasma sintering was first used to prepare the Co25Cr25Cu12.5Ni25Al12.5 CCA clad layer directly on a Q235 substrate from simple mixed powders. Our results show that the CCA coating was fabricated successfully on the substrate and that the clad layer exhibited a dense microstructure, a low dilution ratio and good metallurgical bonding with the substrate. A high density of hierarchical intragranular nanoprecipitates was contained in the dad layer. Precipitation strengthening, as one of the main strengthening mechanisms, contributes to a microhardness value of 455 HV for the clad layer, which is much higher than those of most reported FCC-structured HEAs, even some BCC-structured refractory HEM and several BCC-based HEM with high Al contents.

In-situ observation of the growth behavior of ZnAl-LDHs-NO3 film was studied by electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) and open circuit potential (OCP). The characteristics of the ZnAl-LDHs-NO3 film was analyzed through the X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning electronic microscope. The corrosion behavior of the LDHs film was investigated by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and polarization curves. The results indicate that the growth process of the ZnAl-LDHs-NO3 film can be divided into the dissolution of Al substrate stage, the formation of Al(OH)(3) stage, the nucleation of ZnAl-LDHs-NO3 stage and the growth of ZnAl-LDHs stage. The growth mechanism of each stage is explained in detail. The ZnAl-LDHs film is composed of the interconnected two-dimensional nano-sheets, and the microcrystals grow perpendicular to the Al substrate and cover the entire Al substrate surface. The size and thickness of the ZnAl-LDHs nano-sheets gradually increase with the increasing of the growth time, meantime, the [Zn2+]/[Al3+] content ratio in the ZnAl-LDHs also increases. The ZnAl-LDHs film can significantly improve the corrosion resistance of the Al substrate. (C) 2019 The Authors.

However, conventional slurry-coating- and vacuum-filtration-designed barriers usually show poor particle connection and require extra binder. Herein, we propose a facile in situ growth method and a subsequent compression strategy to design multifunctional NiCo2S4 (NiCoS) nanosheet arrays on a PP membrane for high-performance Li-S batteries. The in situ grown NiCoS nanosheet arrays are interconnected, conductive and closely adhered to the PP membrane without using any binder. After mechanical compression treatment, the overall NiCoS film is compacted, lightweight (0.148 mg cm(-2)) and ultrathin (0.8 mu m). Density functional theory calculations combined with adsorption and diffusion tests prove that the NiCoS nanosheets have highly efficient physical/chemical entrapping capabilities for preventing polysulfide shuttling. Moreover, in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrated that the NiCoS barrier could efficiently suppress polysulfide diffusion and concurrently facilitate redox reactions. When applying this multifunctional separator, a sulfur/carbon nanotube (S/CNT) cathode with high sulfur content (75 wt%) delivers significantly improved long-term cycling performance, with 0.056% capacity decay per cycle over 500 cycles. This work opens up new opportunities to design multifunctional separators by an in situ growth strategy for high-performance Li-S batteries.","[Huang, Shaozhuan; Wang, Ye; Hu, Junping; Von Lim, Yew; Kong, Dezhi; Guo, Lu; Yang, Hui Ying] Singapore Univ Technol & Design, Pillar Engn Prod Dev, 8 Somapah Rd, Singapore 487372, Singapore; [Huang, Shaozhuan] South Cent Univ Nationalities, Hubei Key Lab Catalysis & Mat Sci, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Wang, Ye] Zhengzhou Univ, Sch Phys & Engn, Key Lab Mat Phys, Minist Educ, Zhengzhou 450052, Henan, Peoples R China; [Kou, Zongkui] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Singapore 117574, Singapore; [Chen, Yaxin] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Key Lab Electrochem Proc & Technol Mat, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China",Singapore University of Technology & Design; South Central Minzu University; Zhengzhou University; National University of Singapore; Beijing University of Chemical Technology,"Yang, HY (corresponding author), Singapore Univ Technol & Design, Pillar Engn Prod Dev, 8 Somapah Rd, Singapore 487372, Singapore.",yanghuiying@sutd.edu.sg,"Guo, Lu/U-3535-2019; Ye, Wang/AAG-8998-2020; Kou, Zongkui/K-9488-2017; YANG, HUI YING/B-5458-2011","Guo, lu/0000-0002-4384-513X; Kou, Zongkui/0000-0002-5377-2376; YANG, HUI YING/0000-0002-2244-8231","National Research Foundation, Prime Minister's Office, Singapore, under its NRF-ANR Joint Grant Call (NRF-ANR) [NRF2015-NRF-ANR000-CEENEMA]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [21603192, U1804132]","National Research Foundation, Prime Minister's Office, Singapore, under its NRF-ANR Joint Grant Call (NRF-ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This research is supported by the National Research Foundation, Prime Minister's Office, Singapore, under its NRF-ANR Joint Grant Call (NRF-ANR Award No. NRF2015-NRF-ANR000-CEENEMA).

Such selection pressure on the hosts has driven the evolution of defense behaviors such as egg rejection against cuckoo parasitism. Studies have shown that Cinereous Tits (Parus cinereus) in China have a good ability for recognizing foreign eggs. However, it is unclear whether egg spots play a role in egg recognition. The aims of our study were to investigate the egg recognition ability of two Cinereous Tit populations in China and to explore the role of spots in egg recognition. Methods To test the effect of eggshell spots on egg recognition, pure white eggs of the White-rumped Munia (Lonchura striata) and eggs of White-rumped Munia painted with red brown spots were used to simulate experimental parasitism. Results Egg experiments showed that Cinereous Tits rejected 51.5% of pure white eggs of the White-rumped Munia, but only 14.3% of spotted eggs of the White-rumped Munia. There was a significant difference in egg recognition and rejection rate between the two egg types. Conclusions We conclude that eggshell spots on Cinereous Tit eggs had a signaling function and may be essential to tits for recognizing and rejecting parasitic eggs.","[Liu, Jianping; Yang, Canchao; Liang, Wei] Hainan Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Ecol Trop Isl, Haikou 571158, Hainan, Peoples R China; [Yu, Jiangping; Wang, Haitao] Northeast Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Jilin Engn Lab Avian Ecol & Conservat Genet, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China; [Yu, Jiangping] Northeast Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China; [Wang, Haitao] Northeast Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Jilin Prov Key Lab Anim Resource Conservat & Util, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China",Hainan Normal University; Northeast Normal University - China; Northeast Normal University - China; Northeast Normal University - China,"Liang, W (corresponding author), Hainan Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Ecol Trop Isl, Haikou 571158, Hainan, Peoples R China.",liujp@hainnu.edu.cn; liangwei@hainnu.edu.cn,"Jianping, Liu/J-5248-2018","Liang, Wei/0000-0002-0004-9707; Liu, Jianping/0000-0001-6526-8831; Yang, Canchao/0000-0001-9405-2749","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31772453, 31970427, 31672303, 31770419]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 31772453 and 31970427 to WL, No. 31672303 to CY and No. 31770419 to HW).",,80.0,11,12,3,20,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2053-7166,,,AVIAN RES,Avian Res.,OCT 4,2019,10.0,1,,,,,,,37,10.1186/s40657-019-0178-1,0.0,,,6.0,Ornithology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology,JC0FG,,gold,,,2025-04-23,WOS:000488954300001,0,

Differences in chemical content and location of the Co-based pigments in the coatings were highlighted and explained according to the colouring reaction mechanisms.","[Casademont, Christophe; Roche, Jerome; Arurault, Laurent] Univ Toulouse 3 Paul Sabatier, CIRIMAT, Univ Toulouse, CNRS, Bat CIRIMAT,118 Route Narbonne, F-31062 Toulouse 9, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Arurault, L (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse 3 Paul Sabatier, CIRIMAT, Univ Toulouse, CNRS, Bat CIRIMAT,118 Route Narbonne, F-31062 Toulouse 9, France.",arurault@chimie.ups-tlse.fr,,,French Ministry of Industry (DIRECCTE); Prefecture de Region Midi-Pyrenees,French Ministry of Industry (DIRECCTE); Prefecture de Region Midi-Pyrenees,The French Ministry of Industry (DIRECCTE) and the 'Prefecture de Region Midi-Pyrenees' are gratefully acknowledged for the financial support they provided for this project.,,30.0,0,1,3,30,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0267-0844,1743-2944,,SURF ENG,Surf.
